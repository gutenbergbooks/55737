<br /><span class="h2line2">THE WEAVING OF THE MAGIC CLOAK.</span></h2>
<p>The fairies assembled one moonlit night in a pretty
clearing of the ancient forest of Burzee.</p>
<p>The clearing was in the form of a circle, and all
around stood giant oak and fir trees, while in the
center the grass grew green and soft as velvet. If
any mortal had ever penetrated so far into the great
forest, and could have looked upon the fairy circle by
daylight, he might perhaps have seen a tiny path
worn in the grass by the feet of the dancing elves.
For here, during the full of the moon, the famous
fairy band, ruled by good Queen Lulea, loved to
dance and make merry while the silvery rays flooded
the clearing and caused their gauzy wings to sparkle
with every color of the rainbow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<p>On this especial night, however, they were not
dancing. For the queen had seated herself upon a
little green mound, and while her band clustered
about her she began to address the fairies in a tone
of discontent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am tired of dancing, my dears,&rdquo; said she.
&ldquo;Every evening since the moon grew big and round
we have come here to frisk about and laugh and disport
ourselves; and although those are good things
to keep the heart light, one may grow weary even of
merrymaking. So I ask you to suggest some new way
to divert both me and yourselves during this night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is a hard task,&rdquo; answered one pretty sprite,
opening and folding her wings slowly&mdash;as a lady
toys with her fan. &ldquo;We have lived through so many
ages that we long ago exhausted everything that
might be considered a novelty, and of all our recreations
nothing gives us such continued pleasure as dancing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I do not care to dance to-night!&rdquo; replied
Lulea, with a little frown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might create something, by virtue of our
fairy powers,&rdquo; suggested one who reclined at the feet
of the queen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, that is just the idea!&rdquo; exclaimed the dainty
Lulea, with brightening countenance. &ldquo;Let us create
something. But what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have heard,&rdquo; remarked another member of the
band, &ldquo;of a thinking-cap having been made by some
fairies in America. And whatever mortal wore this
thinking-cap was able to conceive the most noble and
beautiful thoughts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was indeed a worthy creation,&rdquo; cried the
little queen. &ldquo;What became of the cap?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man who received it was so afraid some one
else would get it and be able to think the same
exquisite thoughts as himself that he hid it safely
away&mdash;so safely that he himself never could think
afterward where he had placed it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How unfortunate! But we must not make
another thinking-cap, lest it meet a like fate. Cannot
you suggest something, else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have heard,&rdquo; said another, &ldquo;of certain fairies
who created a pair of enchanted boots, which would
always carry their mortal wearer away from danger&mdash;and
never into it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>&ldquo;What a great boon to those blundering mortals!&rdquo;
cried the queen. &ldquo;And whatever became of the
boots?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They came at last into the possession of a great
general who did not know their powers. So he wore
them into battle one day, and immediately ran away,
followed by all his men, and the fight was won by
the enemy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But did not the general escape danger?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;at the expense of his reputation. So he
retired to a farm and wore out the boots tramping up
and down a country road and trying to decide why
he had suddenly become such a coward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The boots were worn by the wrong man, surely,&rdquo;
said the queen; &ldquo;and that is why they proved a curse
rather than a blessing. But we want no enchanted
boots. Think of something else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose we weave a magic cloak,&rdquo; proposed Espa,
a sweet little fairy who had not before spoken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A cloak? Indeed, we might easily weave that,&rdquo;
returned the queen. &ldquo;But what sort of magic powers
must it possess?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let its wearer have any wish instantly fulfilled,&rdquo;
said Espa, brightly.</p>

<p class="caption">&ldquo;&lsquo;SUPPOSE WE WEAVE A MAGIC CLOAK.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>But at this there arose quite a murmur of protest
on all sides, which the queen immediately silenced
with a wave of her royal hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>&ldquo;Our sister did not think of the probable consequences
of what she suggested,&rdquo; declared Lulea, smiling
into the downcast face of little Espa, who seemed
to feel rebuked by the disapproval of the others. &ldquo;An
instant&rsquo;s reflection would enable her to see that such
power would give the cloak&rsquo;s mortal wearer as many
privileges as we ourselves possess. And I suppose
you intended the magic cloak for a mortal wearer?&rdquo;
she inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Espa, shyly; &ldquo;that was my
intention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the idea is good, nevertheless,&rdquo; continued
the queen, &ldquo;and I propose we devote this evening to
weaving the magic cloak. Only, its magic shall give
to its wearer the fulfilment of but one wish; and I
am quite sure that even that should prove a great
boon to the helpless mortals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose more than one person wears the cloak,&rdquo;
one of the band said; &ldquo;which then shall have the
one wish fulfilled?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The queen devoted a moment to thought, and then
replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Each possessor of the magic cloak may have one
wish granted, provided the cloak is not stolen from
its last wearer. In that case the magic power will
not be exercised on behalf of the thief.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>&ldquo;But should there not be a limit to the number of
the cloak&rsquo;s wearers?&rdquo; asked the fairy lying at the
queen&rsquo;s feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think not. If used properly our gift will prove
of great value to mortals. And if we find it is misused
we can at any time take back the cloak and
revoke its magic power. So now, if we are all agreed
upon this novel amusement, let us set to work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At these words the fairies sprang up eagerly; and
their queen, smiling upon them, waved her wand
toward the center of the clearing. At once a beautiful
fairy loom appeared in the space. It was not
such a loom as mortals use. It consisted of a large
and a small ring of gold, supported by a tall pole of
jasper. The entire band danced around it thrice, the
fairies carrying in each hand a silver shuttle wound
with glossy filaments finer than the finest silk. And
the threads on each shuttle appeared a different hue
from those of all the other shuttles.</p>
<p>At a sign from the queen they one and all
approached the golden loom and fastened an end of
thread in its warp. Next moment they were gleefully
dancing hither and thither, while the silver shuttles
flew swiftly from hand to hand and the gossamer-like
web began to grow upon the loom.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>Presently the queen herself took part in the sport,
and the thread she wove into the fabric was the
magical one which was destined to give the cloak its
wondrous power.</p>
<p>Long and swiftly the fairy band worked beneath
the old moon&rsquo;s rays, while their feet tripped gracefully
over the grass and their joyous laughter tinkled like
silver bells and awoke the echoes of the grim forest
surrounding them. And at last they paused and
threw themselves upon the green with little sighs of
content. For the shuttles and loom had vanished;
the work was complete; and Queen Lulea stood
upon the mound holding in her hand the magic
cloak.</p>
<p>The garment was as beautiful as it was marvelous&mdash;each
and every hue of the rainbow glinted and
sparkled from the soft folds; and while it was light
in weight as swan&rsquo;s-down, its strength was so great
that the fabric was well-nigh indestructible.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>The fairy band regarded it with great satisfaction,
for every one had assisted in its manufacture and
could admire with pardonable pride its glossy folds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is very lovely, indeed!&rdquo; cried little Espa.
&ldquo;But to whom shall we present it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The question aroused a dozen suggestions, each
fairy seeming to favor a different mortal. Every
member of this band, as you doubtless know, was
the unseen guardian of some man or woman or child
in the great world beyond the forest, and it was but
natural that each should wish her own ward have
the magic cloak.</p>
<p>While they thus disputed, another fairy joined
them and pressed to the side of the queen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Welcome, Ereol,&rdquo; said Lulea. &ldquo;You are late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The new-comer was very lovely in appearance, and
with her fluffy golden hair and clear blue eyes was
marvelously fair to look upon. In a low, grave voice
she answered the queen:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, your Majesty, I am late. But I could not help
it. The old King of Noland, whose guardian I have
been since his birth, has passed away this evening,
and I could not bear to leave him until the end came.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>&ldquo;So the old king is dead at last!&rdquo; said the queen,
thoughtfully. &ldquo;He was a good man, but woefully
uninteresting; and he must have wearied you greatly
at times, my sweet Ereol.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="pic3">
<img src="images/i_012_0035.jpg" alt="" width="733" height="592" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;&lsquo;YES, YOUR MAJESTY, I AM LATE.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;All mortals are, I think, wearisome,&rdquo; returned
the fairy, with a sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who is the new King of Noland?&rdquo; asked
Lulea.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>&ldquo;There is none,&rdquo; answered Ereol. &ldquo;The old king
died without a single relative to succeed to his throne,
and his five high counselors were in a great dilemma
when I came away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my dear, you may rest and enjoy yourself
for a period, in order to regain your old lightsome
spirits. By and by I will appoint you guardian to
some newly born babe, that your duties may be less
arduous. But I am sorry you were not with us
to-night, for we have had rare sport. See! we have
woven a magic cloak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ereol examined the garment with pleasure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who is to wear it?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>Then again arose the good-natured dispute as to
which mortal in all the world should possess the
magic cloak. Finally the queen, laughing at the
arguments of her band, said to them:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come! Let us leave the decision to the Man in
the Moon. He has been watching us with a great
deal of amusement, and once, I am sure, I caught
him winking at us in quite a roguish way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this every head was turned toward the moon;
and then a man&rsquo;s face, full-bearded and wrinkled, but
with a jolly look upon the rough features, appeared
sharply defined upon the moon&rsquo;s broad surface.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>&ldquo;So I&rsquo;m to decide another dispute, eh?&rdquo; said he,
in a clear voice. &ldquo;Well, my dears, what is it this time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We wish you to say what mortal shall wear the
magic cloak which I and the ladies of my court have
woven,&rdquo; replied Queen
Lulea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give it to the first unhappy
person you meet,&rdquo;
said the Man in the Moon.
&ldquo;The happy mortals have
no need of magic cloaks.&rdquo;
And with this advice the
friendly face of the Man
in the Moon faded away
until only the outlines remained
visible against the
silver disk.</p>
<p>The queen clapped her
hands delightedly.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic4">

<p class="caption">&ldquo;&lsquo;GIVE IT TO THE FIRST UNHAPPY PERSON YOU MEET.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>&ldquo;Our Man in the Moon
is very wise,&rdquo; she declared;
&ldquo;and we shall follow his suggestion. Go, Ereol,
since you are free for a time, and carry the magic
cloak to Noland. And the first person you meet
who is really unhappy, be it man, woman, or child,
shall receive from you the
cloak as a gift from our
fairy band.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ereol bowed, and folded
the cloak over her arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, my children,&rdquo;
continued Lulea; &ldquo;the
moon is hiding behind the
tree-tops, and it is time
for us to depart.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c2"><span class="h2line1"><span class="sc">Chapter II.</span></span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE BOOK OF LAWS.</span></h2>
<p>On this same night great confusion and excitement
prevailed among the five high counselors of the kingdom
of Noland. The old king was dead and there
was none to succeed him as ruler of the country. He
had outlived every one of his relatives, and since the
crown had been in this one family for generations, it
puzzled the high counselors to decide upon a fitting
successor.</p>
<p>These five high counselors were very important
men. It was said that they ruled the kingdom while
the king ruled them; which made it quite easy for
the king and rather difficult for the people. The
chief counselor was named Tullydub. He was old
and very pompous, and had a great respect for the
laws of the land. The next in rank was Tollydob,
the lord high general of the king&rsquo;s army. The third
was Tillydib, the lord high purse-bearer. The fourth
was Tallydab, the lord high steward. And the fifth
and last of the high counselors was Tellydeb, the lord
high executioner.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>These five had been careful not to tell the people
when the old king had become ill, for they feared
being annoyed by many foolish questions. They sat
in a big room next the bed-chamber of the king, in
the royal palace of Nole,&mdash;which is the capital city
of Noland,&mdash;and kept every one out except the king&rsquo;s
physician, who was half blind and wholly dumb and
could not gossip with outsiders had he wanted to.
And while the high counselors sat and waited for the
king to recover or die, as he might choose, Jikki
waited upon them and brought them their meals.</p>
<p>Jikki was the king&rsquo;s valet and principal servant.
He was as old as any of the five high counselors;
but they were all fat, whereas Jikki was wonderfully
lean and thin; and the counselors were solemn and
dignified, whereas Jikki was terribly nervous and very
talkative.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>&ldquo;Beg pardon, my masters,&rdquo; he would say every
five minutes, &ldquo;but do you think his Majesty will get
well?&rdquo; And then, before any of the high counselors
could collect themselves to answer, he continued:
&ldquo;Beg pardon, but do you think his Majesty will die?&rdquo;
And the next moment he would say: &ldquo;Beg pardon,
but do you think his Majesty is any better or any
worse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And all this was so annoying to the high counselors
that several times one of them took up some
object in the room with the intention of hurling it at
Jikki&rsquo;s head; but before he could throw it the old
servant had nervously turned away and left the
room.</p>
<p>Tellydeb, the lord high executioner, would often
sigh: &ldquo;I wish there were some law that would permit
me to chop off Jikki&rsquo;s head.&rdquo; But then Tullydub,
the chief counselor, would say gloomily; &ldquo;There
is no law but the king&rsquo;s will, and he insists that Jikki
be allowed to live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they were forced to bear with Jikki as best
they could; but after the king breathed his last
breath the old servant became more nervous and
annoying than ever.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>Hearing that the king was dead, Jikki made a
rush for the door of the bell-tower, but tripped over
the foot of Tollydob and fell upon the marble floor
so violently that his bones rattled, and he picked
himself up half dazed by the
fall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo;
asked Tollydob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To toll the bell for the
king&rsquo;s death,&rdquo; answered Jikki.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic7">
<img src="images/i_020_0037.jpg" alt="" width="740" height="630" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;&lsquo;WHERE ARE YOU GOING?&rsquo; ASKED TOLLYDOB.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, remain here until
we give you permission to go,&rdquo; commanded the lord
high general.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the bell ought to be tolled!&rdquo; said Jikki.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>&ldquo;Be silent!&rdquo; growled the lord high purse-bearer.
&ldquo;We know what ought to be done and what ought
not to be done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But this was not strictly true. In fact, the five
high counselors did not know what ought to be done
under these strange circumstances.</p>
<p>If they told the people the king was dead, and did
not immediately appoint his successor, then the whole
population would lose faith in them and fall to fighting
and quarreling among themselves as to who
should become king; and that would never in the
world do.</p>
<p>No; it was evident that a new king must be chosen
before they told the people that the old king was
dead.</p>
<p>But whom should they choose for the new king?
That was the important question.</p>
<p>While they talked of these matters, the ever-active
Jikki kept rushing in and saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t I better toll the bell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; they would shout in a chorus; and then
Jikki would rush out again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>So they sat and thought and counseled together
during the whole long night, and by morning they
were no nearer a solution of the problem than before.</p>
<p>At daybreak Jikki stuck his head into the room
and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t I better&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; they all shouted in a breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; returned Jikki; &ldquo;I was only going to
ask if I hadn&rsquo;t better get you some breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; they cried, again in one breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And shall I toll the bell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; they screamed; and the lord high steward
threw an inkstand that hit the door several seconds
after Jikki had closed it and disappeared.</p>
<p>While they were at breakfast they again discussed
their future action in the choice of a king; and finally
the chief counselor had a thought that caused him to
start so suddenly that he nearly choked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The book!&rdquo; he gasped, staring at his brother
counselors in a rather wild manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What book?&rdquo; asked the lord high general.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The book of laws,&rdquo; answered the chief counselor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never knew there was such a thing,&rdquo; remarked
the lord high executioner, looking puzzled. &ldquo;I
always thought the king&rsquo;s will was the law.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>&ldquo;So it was! So it was when we had a king,&rdquo;
answered Tullydub, excitedly. &ldquo;But this book of
laws was written years ago, and was meant to be used
when the king was absent, or ill, or asleep.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="pic8">
<img src="images/i_023_0039.jpg" alt="" width="733" height="495" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;&lsquo;NO!&rsquo; THEY ALL SHOUTED IN A BREATH.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>For a moment there was silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you ever read the book?&rdquo; then asked
Tillydib.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; but I will fetch it at once, and we shall see
if there is not a law to help us out of our difficulty.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>So the chief counselor brought the book&mdash;a huge
old volume that had a
musty smell to it and
was locked together with
a silver padlock. Then
the key had to be found,
which was no easy task;
but finally the great book
of laws lay open upon
the table, and all the five
periwigs of the five fat
counselors were bent over
it at once.</p>
<p>Long and earnestly
they searched the pages,
but it was not until after
noon that Tullydub suddenly
placed his broad
thumb upon a passage
and shouted:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have it! I have it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it? Read
it! Read it aloud!&rdquo; cried
the others.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic9">
<img src="images/i_024_0040.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="890" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;SO THE CHIEF COUNSELOR BROUGHT THE BOOK.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>Just then Jikki rushed into the room and asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I toll the bell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; they yelled, glaring at him; so Jikki ran
out, shaking his head dolefully.</p>
<p>Then Tullydub adjusted his spectacles and leaned
over the book, reading aloud the following words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;In case the king dies, and there is no one to succeed
him, the chief counselor of the kingdom shall
go at sunrise to the eastward gate of the city of Nole
and count the persons who enter through such gate
as soon as it is opened by the guards. And the
forty-seventh person that so enters, be it man, woman,
or child, rich or poor, humble or noble, shall immediately
be proclaimed king or queen, as the case may
be, and shall rule all the kingdom of Noland forever
after, so long as he or she may live. And if any one
in all the kingdom of Nole shall refuse to obey the
slightest wish of the new ruler, such person shall at
once be put to death. This is the law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then all the five high counselors heaved a deep
sigh of relief and repeated together the words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the law.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s a strange law, nevertheless,&rdquo; remarked
the lord high purse-bearer. &ldquo;I wish I knew who
will be the forty-seventh person to enter the east gate
to-morrow at sunrise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must wait and see,&rdquo; answered the lord high
general. &ldquo;And I will have my army assembled
and marshaled at the gateway, that the new ruler of
Noland may be welcomed in a truly kingly manner,
as well as to keep the people in order when they
hear the strange news.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beg pardon!&rdquo; exclaimed Jikki, looking in at the
doorway, &ldquo;but shall I toll the bell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you numskull!&rdquo; retorted Tullydub, angrily.
&ldquo;If the bell is tolled the people will be told, and they
must not know that the old king is dead until the
forty-seventh person enters the east gateway to-morrow
morning!&rdquo;</p>

<br /><span class="h2line2">THE GIFT OF THE MAGIC CLOAK.</span></h2>
<p>Nearly two days&rsquo; journey from the city of Nole,
yet still within the borders of the great kingdom of
Noland, was a little village lying at the edge of a
broad river. It consisted of a cluster of houses of
the humblest description, for the people of this village
were all poor and lived in simple fashion. Yet one
house appeared to be somewhat better than the others,
for it stood on the river-bank and had been built by
the ferryman whose business it was to carry all travelers
across the river. And, as many traveled that
way, the ferryman was able in time to erect a very
comfortable cottage, and to buy good furniture for it,
and to clothe warmly and neatly his two children.</p>
<p>One of these children was a little girl named Margaret,
who was called &ldquo;Meg&rdquo; by the villagers and
&ldquo;Fluff&rdquo; by the ferryman her father, because her hair
was so soft and fluffy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>Her brother, who was two years younger, was
named Timothy; but Margaret had always called
him &ldquo;Bud,&rdquo; because she could not say &ldquo;brother&rdquo;
more plainly when first she began to talk; so nearly
every one who knew Timothy called him Bud, as
little Meg did.</p>
<p>These children had lost their mother when very
young, and the big ferryman had tried to be both
mother and father to them, and had reared them very
gently and lovingly. They were good children, and
were liked by every one in the village.</p>
<p>But one day a terrible misfortune befell them.
The ferryman tried to cross the river for a passenger
one very stormy night; but he never reached the
other shore. When the storm subsided and morning
came they found his body lying on the river-bank,
and the two children were left alone in the world.</p>
<p>The news was carried by travelers to the city of
Nole, where the ferryman&rsquo;s only sister lived; and a
few days afterward the woman came to the village
and took charge of her orphaned niece and nephew.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>She was not a bad-hearted woman, this Aunt
Rivette; but she had worked hard all her life, and
had a stern face and a stern voice. She thought the
only way to make children behave was to box their
ears every now and then; so poor Meg, who had
been well-nigh heart-broken at her dear father&rsquo;s loss,
had still more occasion for tears after Aunt Rivette
came to the village.</p>
<p>As for Bud, he was so impudent and ill-mannered
to the old lady that she felt obliged to switch him;
and afterward the boy became surly and silent, and
neither wept nor answered his aunt a single word.
It hurt Margaret dreadfully to see her little brother
whipped, and she soon became so unhappy at the
sorrowful circumstances in which she and her brother
found themselves that she sobbed from morning till
night and knew no comfort.</p>
<p>Aunt Rivette, who was a laundress in the city of
Nole, decided she would take Meg and Bud back
home with her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The boy can carry water for my tubs, and the
girl can help me with the ironing,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>So she sold all the heavier articles of furniture that
the cottage contained, as well as the cottage itself;
and all the remainder of her dead brother&rsquo;s belongings
she loaded upon the back of the little donkey
she had ridden on her journey from Nole. It made
such a pile of packages that the load seemed bigger
than the donkey himself; but he was a strong little
animal, and made no complaint of his burden.</p>
<p>All this being accomplished, they set out one
morning for Nole, Aunt Rivette leading the donkey
by the bridle with one hand and little Bud with the
other, while Margaret followed behind, weeping anew
at this sad parting with her old home and all she had
so long loved.</p>
<p>It was a hard journey. The old woman soon
became cross and fretful, and scolded the little ones
at almost every step. When Bud stumbled, as he
often did, for he was unused to walking very far,
Aunt Rivette would box his ears or shake him violently
by the arm or tell him he was &ldquo;a good-for-nothing
little beggar.&rdquo; And Bud would turn upon
her with a revengeful look in his big eyes, but say
not a word. The woman paid no attention to Meg,
who continued to follow the donkey with tearful eyes
and drooping head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<div class="img" id="pic11">
<img src="images/i_033_0171.jpg" alt="" width="732" height="667" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;IT WAS A HARD JOURNEY.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The first night they obtained shelter at a farm-house.
But in the morning it was found that the
boy&rsquo;s feet were so swollen and sore from the long
walk of the day before that he could not stand upon
them. So Aunt Rivette, scolding fretfully at his
weakness, perched Bud among the bundles atop the
donkey&rsquo;s back, and in this way they journeyed the
second day, the woman walking ahead and leading
the donkey, and Margaret following behind.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>The laundress had hoped to reach the city of Nole
at the close of this day; but the overburdened donkey
would not walk very fast, so nightfall found them
still a two-hours&rsquo; journey from the city gates, and
they were forced to stop at a small inn.</p>
<p>But this inn was already overflowing with travelers,
and the landlord could give them no beds, nor
even a room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can sleep in the stable if you like,&rdquo; said he.
&ldquo;There is plenty of hay to lie down upon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they were obliged to content themselves with
this poor accommodation.</p>
<p>The old woman aroused them at the first streaks
of daybreak the next morning, and while she fastened
the packages to the donkey&rsquo;s back Margaret stood in
the stable yard and shivered in the cold morning air.</p>
<p>The little girl felt that she had never been more
unhappy than at that moment, and when she thought
of her kind father and the happy home she had once
known, her sobs broke out afresh, and she leaned
against the stable door and wept as if her little heart
would break.</p>

<p class="caption">&ldquo;OVER THE YOUTH&rsquo;S ARM LAY FOLDED THE MAGIC CLOAK.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>Suddenly some one touched her arm, and she looked
up to see a tall and handsome youth standing before
her. It was none other than Ereol the fairy, who
had assumed this form for her appearance among
mortals; and over the youth&rsquo;s arm lay folded the
magic cloak that had been woven the evening before
in the fairy circle of Burzee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you very unhappy, my dear?&rdquo; asked Ereol,
in kindly tones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am the most unhappy person in all the world!&rdquo;
replied the girl, beginning to sob afresh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Ereol, &ldquo;I will present you with this
magic cloak, which has been woven by the fairies.
And while you wear it you may have your first wish
granted; and if you give it freely to any other mortal,
that person may also have one wish granted. So
use the cloak wisely, and guard it as a great treasure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Saying this the fairy messenger spread the folds of
the cloak and threw the brilliant-hued garment over
the shoulders of the girl.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<div class="img" id="pic13">
<img src="images/i_038_0172.jpg" alt="" width="727" height="786" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;&lsquo;WHAT! PUNISH ME, YOU RASCALLY FELLOW! WE&rsquo;LL SEE ABOUT THAT.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>Just then Aunt Rivette led the donkey from the
stable, and seeing the beautiful cloak which the child
wore, she stopped short and demanded:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you get that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This stranger gave it to me,&rdquo; answered Meg,
pointing to the youth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take it off! Take it off this minute and give it
me&mdash;or I will whip you soundly!&rdquo; cried the woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; said Ereol, sternly. &ldquo;The cloak belongs
to this child alone, and if you dare take it from her I
will punish you severely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! Punish me! Punish me, you rascally
fellow! We&rsquo;ll see about that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will, indeed,&rdquo; returned Ereol, more calmly.
&ldquo;The cloak is a gift from the fairies; and you dare
not anger them, for your punishment would be swift
and terrible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now no one feared to provoke the mysterious
fairies more than Aunt Rivette; but she suspected
the youth was not telling her the truth, so she rushed
upon Ereol and struck at him with her upraised cane.
But, to her amazement, the form of the youth vanished
quickly into air, and then, indeed, she knew it
was a fairy that had spoken to her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>&ldquo;You may keep your cloak,&rdquo; she said to Margaret,
with a little shiver of fear. &ldquo;I would not touch it
for the world!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl was very proud of her glittering garment,
and when Bud was perched upon the donkey&rsquo;s back
and the old woman began trudging along the road to
the city, Meg followed after with much lighter steps
than before.</p>
<p>Presently the sun rose over the horizon, and its
splendid rays shone upon the cloak and made it
glisten gorgeously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, me!&rdquo; sighed the little girl, half aloud. &ldquo;I
wish I could be happy again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then her childish heart gave a bound of delight,
and she laughed aloud and brushed from her eyes
the last tear she was destined to shed for many a day.
For, though she spoke thoughtlessly, the magic cloak
quickly granted to its first wearer the fulfilment of
her wish.</p>
<p>Aunt Rivette turned upon her in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you?&rdquo; she asked suspiciously,
for she had not heard the girl laugh since
her father&rsquo;s death.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<div class="img" id="pic14">
<img src="images/i_041_0173.jpg" alt="" width="544" height="759" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;&lsquo;AH, ME!&rsquo; SIGHED THE LITTLE GIRL, HALF ALOUD.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the sun is shining,&rdquo; answered Meg, laughing
again. &ldquo;And the air is sweet and fresh, and the
trees are green and beautiful, and the whole world is
very pleasant and delightful.&rdquo; And then she danced
lightly along the dusty road and broke into a verse
of a pretty song she had learned at her father&rsquo;s knee.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>The old woman scowled and trudged on again;
Bud looked down at his merry sister and grinned
from pure sympathy with her high spirits; and the
donkey stopped and turned his head to look solemnly
at the laughing girl behind him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come along!&rdquo; cried the laundress, jerking at the
bridle; &ldquo;every one is passing us upon the road, and
we must hurry to get home before noon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was true. A good many travelers, some on
horseback and some on foot, had passed them by
since the sun rose; and although the east gate of the
city of Nole was now in sight, they were obliged to
take their places in the long line that sought entrance
at the gate.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="h2line1"><span class="sc">Chapter IV.</span></span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">KING BUD OF NOLAND.</span></h2>
<p>The five high counselors of the kingdom of Noland
were both eager and anxious upon this important
morning. Long before sunrise Tollydob, the lord
high general, had assembled his army at the east
gate of the city; and the soldiers stood in two long
lines beside the entrance, looking very impressive in
their uniforms. And all the people, noting this unusual
display, gathered around at the gate to see what
was going to happen.</p>
<p>Of course no one knew what was going to happen;
not even the chief counselor nor his brother counselors.
They could only obey the law and abide by
the results.</p>
<p>Finally the sun arose and the east gate of the city
was thrown open. There were a few people waiting
outside, and they promptly entered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>&ldquo;One, two, three, four, five, six!&rdquo; counted the chief
counselor, in a loud voice.</p>
<p>The people were much surprised at hearing this,
and began to question one another with perplexed
looks. Even the soldiers were mystified.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic15">
<img src="images/i_044_0174.jpg" alt="" width="738" height="581" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;A RAGGED, LIMPING PEDDLER ENTERED THE GATE.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Seven, eight, nine!&rdquo; continued the chief counselor,
still counting those who came in.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>A breathless hush fell upon the assemblage.</p>
<p>Something very important and mysterious was
going on; that was evident. But what?</p>
<p>They could only wait and find out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten, eleven!&rdquo; counted Tullydub, and then heaved
a deep sigh. For a famous nobleman had just entered
the gate, and the chief counselor could not help wishing
he had been number forty-seven.</p>
<p>So the counting went on, and the people became
more and more interested and excited.</p>
<p>When the number had reached thirty-one a strange
thing happened. A loud &ldquo;boom!&rdquo; sounded through
the stillness, and then another, and another. Some
one was tolling the great bell in the palace bell-tower,
and people began saying to one another in awed
whispers that the old king must be dead.</p>
<p>The five high counselors, filled with furious anger
but absolutely helpless, as they could not leave the
gate, lifted up their five chubby fists and shook them
violently in the direction of the bell-tower.</p>
<p>Poor Jikki, finding himself left alone in the palace,
could no longer resist the temptation to toll the bell;
and it continued to peal out its dull, solemn tones
while the chief counselor stood by the gate and
shouted:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thirty-two, thirty-three, thirty-four!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Only the mystery of this action could have kept
the people quiet when they learned from the bell that
their old king was dead.</p>
<p>But now they began to guess that the scene at the
east gate promised more of interest than anything
they might learn at the palace; so they stood very
quiet, and Jikki&rsquo;s disobedience of orders did no great
harm to the plans of the five high counselors.</p>
<p>When Tullydub had counted up to forty the excitement
redoubled, for every one could see big drops of
perspiration standing upon the chief counselor&rsquo;s brow,
and all the other high counselors, who stood just behind
him, were trembling violently with nervousness.</p>
<p>A ragged, limping peddler entered the gate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forty-five!&rdquo; shouted Tullydub.</p>
<p>Then came Aunt Rivette, dragging at the bridle
of the donkey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forty-six!&rdquo; screamed Tullydub.</p>
<p>And now Bud rode through the gate, perched
among the bundles on the donkey&rsquo;s back and looking
composedly upon the throng of anxious faces that
greeted him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<div class="img" id="pic16">
<img src="images/i_047_0175.jpg" alt="" width="726" height="980" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;&lsquo;FORTY-SEVEN!&rsquo; CRIED THE CHIEF COUNSELOR. &lsquo;LONG LIVE
THE NEW KING OF NOLAND!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Forty-seven!</i>&rdquo; cried the chief counselor; and then
in his loudest voice he continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Long live the new King of Noland!&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the high counselors prostrated themselves in
the dusty road before the donkey. The old woman
was thrust back in the crowd by a soldier, where she
stood staring in amazement, and Margaret, clothed
in her beautiful cloak, stepped to the donkey&rsquo;s side
and looked first at her brother and then at the group
of periwigged men, who bobbed their heads in the
dust before him and shouted:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Long live the king!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, while the crowd still wondered, the lord high
counselor arose and took from a soldier a golden
crown set with brilliants, a jeweled scepter, and a robe
of ermine. Advancing to Bud, he placed the crown
upon the boy&rsquo;s head and the scepter in his hand,
while over his shoulders he threw the ermine robe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>The crown fell over Bud&rsquo;s ears, but he pushed it
back upon his head, so it would stay there; and as
the kingly robe spread over all the bundles on the
donkey&rsquo;s back and quite covered them, the boy really
presented a very imposing appearance.</p>
<p>The people quickly rose to the spirit of the occasion.
What mattered it if the old king was dead,
now that a new king was already before them? They
broke into a sudden cheer, and, joyously waving their
hats and bonnets above their heads, joined eagerly in
the cry:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Long live the King of Noland!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aunt Rivette was fairly stupefied. Such a thing
was too wonderful to be believed. A man in the
crowd snatched the bonnet from the old woman&rsquo;s
head, and said to her brusquely:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you greet the new king? Are you a
traitor to your country?&rdquo;</p>
<p>So she also waved her bonnet and screamed:
&ldquo;Long live the king!&rdquo; But she hardly knew what
she was doing or why she did it.</p>
<p>Meantime the high counselors had risen from their
knees and now stood around the donkey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May it please your Serene Majesty to condescend
to tell us who this young lady is?&rdquo; asked Tullydub,
bowing respectfully.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my sister Fluff,&rdquo; said Bud, who was
enjoying his new position very much. All the counselors,
at this, bowed low to Margaret.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic17">
<img src="images/i_051_0177.jpg" alt="" width="489" height="816" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;SO SHE ALSO WAVED HER BONNET AND SCREAMED: &lsquo;LONG LIVE THE KING!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;A horse for the Princess Fluff!&rdquo; cried
the lord high general; and
the next moment she was
mounted upon a
handsome white
palfrey, where,
with her fluffy
golden hair and
smiling face and
the magnificent
cloak flowing
from her shoulders,
she looked
every inch a princess.
The people
cheered her,
too; for it was
long since any
girl or woman
had occupied the
palace of the King of Noland, and she was so pretty
and sweet that every one loved her immediately.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<div class="img" id="pic18">
<img src="images/i_052_0178.jpg" alt="" width="717" height="490" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;&lsquo;MAY IT PLEASE YOUR SERENE MAJESTY TO TELL US WHO THIS YOUNG LADY IS?&rsquo; ASKED TULLYDUB, RESPECTFULLY.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>And now the king&rsquo;s chariot drove up, with its six
prancing steeds, and Bud was lifted from the back of
the donkey and placed in the high seat of the chariot.</p>
<p>Again the people shouted joyful greetings; the
band struck up a gay march tune, and then the royal
procession started for the palace.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>First came Tollydob and the officers; then the
king&rsquo;s chariot, surrounded by soldiers; then the four
high counselors upon black horses, riding two on
each side of Princess Fluff; and, finally, the band of
musicians and the remainder of the royal army.</p>
<p>It was an imposing sight, and the people followed
after with cheers and rejoicings, while the lord high
purse-bearer tossed silver coins from his pouch for
any one to catch who could.</p>
<p>A message had been sent to warn Jikki that the
new king was coming, so he stopped tolling the death
knell, and instead rang out a glorious chime of welcome.</p>
<p>As for old Rivette finding herself and the donkey
alike deserted, she once more seized the bridle and
led the patient beast to her humble dwelling; and it
was just as she reached her door that King Bud of
Noland, amid the cheers and shouts of thousands,
entered for the first time the royal palace of Nole.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<div class="img" id="pic19">

<h2 id="c5"><span class="h2line1"><span class="sc">Chapter V.</span></span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">PRINCESS FLUFF.</span></h2>
<p>Now when the new king had entered the palace
with his sister, the chief counselor stood upon a golden
balcony with the great book in his hand, and read
aloud, to all the people who were gathered below, the
law in regard to choosing a new king, and the severe
penalty in case any refused to obey his slightest wish.
And the people were glad enough to have a change
of rulers, and pleased that so young a king had been
given them. So they accepted both the law and the
new king cheerfully, and soon dispersed to their homes
to talk over the wonderful events of the day.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>Bud and Meg were ushered into beautifully furnished
rooms on the second floor of the palace, and
old Jikki, finding that he had a new master to serve,
flew about in his usual nervous manner, and brought
the children the most delicious breakfast they had
ever eaten in their lives.</p>
<p>Bud had been so surprised at his reception at the
gate and the sudden change in his condition that as
yet he had not been able to collect his thoughts. His
principal idea was that he was in a dream, and he
kept waiting until he should wake up. But the
breakfast was very real and entirely satisfying, and
he began to wonder if he could be dreaming, after
all.</p>
<p>The old servant, when he carried away the dishes,
bowed low to Bud and said: &ldquo;Beg pardon, your
Majesty! But the lord high counselor desires to
know the king&rsquo;s will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bud stared at him a moment thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell him I want to be left alone to talk with my
sister Fluff,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
<p>Jikki again bowed low and withdrew, closing the
door behind him, and then the children looked at
each other solemnly, until Meg burst into a merry
laugh.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Bud!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;think of it! I&rsquo;m the
royal Princess Fluff, and you&rsquo;re the King of all
Noland! Isn&rsquo;t it funny!&rdquo; And then she danced
about the room in great delight.</p>
<p>Bud answered her seriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does it all mean, Fluff?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
only poor children, you know; so I can&rsquo;t really be a
king. And I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if Aunt Rivette
came in any minute and boxed my ears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; laughed Margaret. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you
hear what that fat, periwigged man said about the
law? The old king is dead, and some one else had
to be king, you know; and the forty-seventh person
who entered the east gate was you, Bud, and so by
law you are the king of all this great country. Don&rsquo;t
you see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bud shook his head and looked at his sister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t see,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But if you say it&rsquo;s
all right, Fluff, why, it must be all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; declared the girl, throwing
off her pretty cloak and placing it on a chair.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the rightful king, and can do whatever you
please; and I&rsquo;m the rightful princess, because I&rsquo;m
your sister; so I can do whatever <i>I</i> please. Don&rsquo;t
you see, Bud?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>&ldquo;But, look here, Fluff,&rdquo; returned her brother, &ldquo;if
you&rsquo;re a princess, why do you wear that old gray
dress and those patched-up shoes? Father used to
tell us that princesses always wore the loveliest
dresses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meg looked at herself and sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really ought to have some new dresses, Bud.
And I suppose if you order them they will be ready
in no time. And you must have some new clothes,
too, for your jacket is ragged and soiled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you really think it&rsquo;s true, Fluff?&rdquo; he asked
anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it&rsquo;s true. Look at your kingly robe,
and your golden crown, and that stick with all those
jewels in it!&rdquo;&mdash;meaning the scepter. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re true
enough, aren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bud nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Call in that old man,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll order something,
and see if he obeys me. If he does, then I&rsquo;ll
believe I&rsquo;m really a king.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>&ldquo;But now listen, Bud,&rdquo; said Meg, gravely; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
you let these folks see you&rsquo;re afraid, or that you&rsquo;re
not sure whether you&rsquo;re a king or not. Order them
around and make them afraid of <i>you</i>. That&rsquo;s what
the kings do in all the stories I ever read.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; replied Bud. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll order them around.
So you call in that old donkey with the silver buttons
all over him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a bell-rope,&rdquo; said Meg; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pull it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instantly Jikki entered and bowed low to each of
the children.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo; asked Bud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jikki, your gracious Majesty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Majesty&rsquo;s valet, if you please,&rdquo; answered
Jikki.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Bud. He didn&rsquo;t know what a valet
was, but he wasn&rsquo;t going to tell Jikki so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want some new clothes, and so does my sister,&rdquo;
Bud announced, as boldly as possible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, your Majesty. I&rsquo;ll send the lord high
steward here at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this he bowed and rushed away, and presently
Tallydab, the lord high steward, entered the
room and with a low bow presented himself respectfully
before the children.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your Majesty to command me,&rdquo; said Tallydab,
gravely.</p>
<p>Bud was a little awed by his appearance, but he
resolved to be brave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want some new clothes,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are already ordered, your Majesty, and will
be here presently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Bud, and stopped short.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have ordered twenty suits for your Majesty and
forty gowns for the princess,&rdquo; continued Tallydab; &ldquo;and
I hope these will content your Majesty and the princess
until you have time to select a larger assortment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Bud, greatly amazed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have also selected seven maidens, the most
noble in all the land, to wait upon the princess.
They are even now awaiting her Highness in her
own apartments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meg clapped her hands delightedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go to them at once,&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has your Majesty any further commands?&rdquo; asked
Tallydab. &ldquo;If not your five high counselors would
like to confer with you in regard to your new duties
and responsibilities.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>&ldquo;Send &rsquo;em in,&rdquo; said Bud, promptly; and while
Margaret went to meet her new maids the king held
his first conference with his high counselors.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic20">
<img src="images/i_061_0302.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="742" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;&lsquo;I HAVE ORDERED TWENTY SUITS FOR YOUR MAJESTY AND FORTY GOWNS FOR THE PRINCESS.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>In answer to Tallydab&rsquo;s summons the other four
periwigs, pompous and solemn, filed into the room
and stood in a row before Bud, who looked upon
them with a sensation of awe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Majesty,&rdquo; began the venerable Tullydub, in
a grave voice, &ldquo;we are here to instruct you, with your
gracious consent, in your new and important duties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bud shifted uneasily in his chair. It all seemed
so unreal and absurd&mdash;this kingly title and polite
deference bestowed upon a poor boy by five dignified
and periwigged men&mdash;that it was hard for Bud to
curb his suspicion that all was not right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here, all of you,&rdquo; said he, suddenly, &ldquo;is this
thing a joke? tell me, is it a joke?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A joke?&rdquo; echoed all of the five counselors, in
several degrees of shocked and horrified tones; and
Tellydeb, the lord high executioner, added reproachfully:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could we, by any chance, have the temerity to
joke with your mighty and glorious Majesty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just it,&rdquo; answered the boy. &ldquo;I am not a
mighty and glorious Majesty. I&rsquo;m just Bud, the
ferryman&rsquo;s son, and you know it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>&ldquo;You are Bud, the ferryman&rsquo;s son, to be sure,&rdquo;
agreed the chief counselor, bowing courteously; &ldquo;but
by the decrees of fate and the just and unalterable
laws of the land you are now become absolute ruler
of the great kingdom of Noland; therefore all that
dwell therein are your loyal and obedient servants.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="pic21">
<img src="images/i_063_0303.jpg" alt="" width="730" height="505" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;&lsquo;A JOKE?&rsquo; ECHOED ALL OF THE FIVE COUNSELORS, IN SEVERAL DEGREES OF SHOCKED AND HORRIFIED TONES.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Bud thought this over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure there&rsquo;s no mistake?&rdquo; he asked,
with hesitation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>&ldquo;There <i>can</i> be no mistake,&rdquo; returned old Tullydub,
firmly; &ldquo;for we, the five high counselors of the kingdom,
have ourselves interpreted and carried out the
laws of the land, and the people, your subjects, have
approved our action.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Bud, &ldquo;I suppose I&rsquo;ll have to be king
whether I want to or not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Majesty speaks but the truth,&rdquo; returned the
chief counselor, with a sigh. &ldquo;With or without your
consent, you are the king. It is the law.&rdquo; And all
the others chanted in a chorus:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bud felt much relieved. He had no notion whatever
of refusing to be a king. If there was no mistake,
and he was really the powerful monarch of
Noland, then there ought to be no end of fun and
freedom for him during the rest of his life. To be
his own master; to have plenty of money; to live in
a palace and order people around as he pleased&mdash;all
this seemed to the poor and friendless boy of yesterday
to be quite the most delightful fate that could
possibly overtake one.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>So lost did he become in thoughts of the marvelous
existence opening before him that he paid scant
attention to the droning speeches of the five aged
counselors, who were endeavoring to acquaint him
with the condition of affairs in his new kingdom, and
to instruct him in his many and difficult duties as its
future ruler.</p>
<p>For a full hour he sat quiet and motionless, and
they thought he was listening to these dreary affairs
of state; but suddenly he jumped up and astonished
the dignitaries by exclaiming:</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here; you just fix up things to suit yourselves.
I&rsquo;m going to find Fluff.&rdquo; And with no
heed to protests, the new king ran from the room
and slammed the door behind him.</p>

<br /><span class="h2line2">BUD DISPENSES JUSTICE.</span></h2>
<p>The next day the funeral of the old king took place,
and the new king rode in the grand procession in a
fine chariot, clothed in black velvet embroidered with
silver. Not knowing how to act in his new position,
Bud sat still and did nothing at all, which was just
what was expected of him.</p>
<p>But when they returned from the funeral he was
ushered into the great throne-room of the palace and
seated on the golden throne; and then the chief counselor
informed him that he must listen to the grievances
of his people and receive the homage of the
noblemen of Noland.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>Fluff sat on a stool beside the king, and the five
high counselors stood back of him in a circle; and
then the doors were thrown open and all the noblemen
of the country crowded in. One by one they
kissed first the king&rsquo;s hand and then the princess&rsquo;s
hand, and vowed they would always serve them
faithfully.</p>
<p>Bud did not like this ceremony. He whispered
to Fluff that it made him tired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to go upstairs and play,&rdquo; he said to the
lord high steward. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very soon your Majesty may go. Just now it
is your duty to hear the grievances of your people,&rdquo;
answered Tallydab, gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with &rsquo;em?&rdquo; asked Bud, crossly.
&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t they keep out of trouble?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know, your Majesty; but there are
always disputes among the people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that isn&rsquo;t the king&rsquo;s fault, is it?&rdquo; said Bud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, your Majesty; but it&rsquo;s the king&rsquo;s place to
settle these disputes, for he has the supreme power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, tell &rsquo;em to hurry up and get it over with,&rdquo;
said the boy, restlessly.</p>
<p>Then a venerable old man came in leading a boy
by the arm and holding a switch in his other hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>&ldquo;Your Majesty,&rdquo; began the man, having first humbly
bowed to the floor before the king, &ldquo;my son, whom
I have brought here with me, insists upon running
away from home, and I wish you would tell me what
to do with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you run away?&rdquo; Bud asked the boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because he whips me,&rdquo; was the answer.</p>
<p>Bud turned to the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you whip the boy?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because he runs away,&rdquo; said the man.</p>
<p>For a minute Bud looked puzzled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if any one whipped me, I&rsquo;d run away, too,&rdquo;
he said at last. &ldquo;And if the boy isn&rsquo;t whipped or
abused he ought to stay at home and be good. But
it&rsquo;s none of my business, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, your Majesty!&rdquo; cried the chief counselor,
&ldquo;it really must be your business. You&rsquo;re the king,
you know; and everybody&rsquo;s business is the king&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t fair,&rdquo; said Bud, sulkily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got
my own business to attend to, and I want to go upstairs
and play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But now Princess Fluff leaned toward the young
king and whispered something in his ear which made
his face brighten.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>&ldquo;See here!&rdquo; exclaimed Bud, &ldquo;the first time this
man whips the boy again, or the first time the boy
runs away, I order my lord high executioner to give
them both a good switching. Now let them go home
and try to behave themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="pic23">
<img src="images/i_070_0305.jpg" alt="" width="736" height="574" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;NEXT CAME TWO OLD WOMEN, AND BETWEEN THEM THEY LED A COW.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Every one applauded his decision, and Bud also
thought with satisfaction that he had hit upon a good
way out of the difficulty.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>Next came two old women, one very fat and the
other very thin; and between them they led a cow,
the fat woman having a rope around one horn and
the thin woman a rope around the other horn. Each
woman claimed she owned the cow, and they quarreled
so loudly and so long that the lord high executioner
had to tie a bandage over their mouths. When
peace was thus restored the high counselor said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, your Majesty, please decide which of these
two women owns the cow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Bud, helplessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, your Majesty, but you must!&rdquo; cried all the
five high counselors.</p>
<p>Then Meg whispered to the king again, and the
boy nodded. The children had always lived in a
little village where there were plenty of cows, and the
girl thought she knew a way to decide which of the
claimants owned this animal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Send one of the women away,&rdquo; said Bud. So
they led the lean woman to a little room near by and
locked her in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring a pail and a milking-stool,&rdquo; ordered the
king.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>When they were brought, Bud turned to the fat
woman and ordered the bandage taken from her
mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cow&rsquo;s mine! It&rsquo;s my cow! I own it!&rdquo;
she screamed, the moment she could speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold!&rdquo; said the king. &ldquo;If the cow belongs to
you, let me see you milk her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, your Majesty, certainly!&rdquo; she cried;
and seizing the pail and the stool, she ran up to the
left side of the cow, placed the stool, and sat down
upon it. But before she could touch the cow the
animal suddenly gave a wild kick that sent the
startled woman in a heap upon the floor, with her
head stuck fast in the milk-pail. Then the cow moved
forward a few steps and looked blandly around.</p>
<p>Two of the guards picked the woman up and pulled
the pail from her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; asked Bud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s frightened, of course,&rdquo; whimpered the
woman, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll be black and blue by to-morrow
morning, your Majesty. Any cow would kick in
such a place as this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put this woman in the room and fetch the other
woman here,&rdquo; commanded the king.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>So the lean woman was brought out and ordered
to milk the cow.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic24">
<img src="images/i_073_0306.jpg" alt="" width="724" height="583" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;THE ANIMAL SUDDENLY GAVE A WILD KICK THAT SENT THE STARTLED WOMAN IN A HEAP UPON THE FLOOR,
WITH HER HEAD STUCK FAST IN THE MILK-PAIL.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>She took the stool in one hand and the pail in the
other, and, approaching the cow softly on the <i>right</i>
side, patted the animal gently and said to it: &ldquo;So,
Boss! So-o-o-o, Bossie, my darlin&rsquo;! Good Bossie!
Nice Bossie!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>The cow turned her head to look at the lean woman,
and made no objection when she sat down and began
milking.</p>
<p>In a moment the king said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cow is yours! Take her and go home!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then all the courtiers and people&mdash;and even the
five high counselors&mdash;applauded the king enthusiastically;
and the chief counselor lifted up his hands
and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another Solomon has come to rule us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the people applauded again, till Bud looked
very proud and quite red in the face with satisfaction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; he said to the woman, who was about
to lead the cow away, &ldquo;tell me, where did you get
such a nice faithful Bossie as that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must I tell you the truth?&rdquo; asked the woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Bud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, your Majesty,&rdquo; she returned, &ldquo;I stole her
from that fat woman you have locked up in that room.
But no one can take the cow from me now, for the
king has given her to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this a sudden hush fell on the room, and Bud
looked redder than ever.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then how did it happen that you could milk the
cow and she couldn&rsquo;t?&rdquo; demanded the king, angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, she doesn&rsquo;t understand cows, and I do,&rdquo;
answered the woman. &ldquo;Good day, your Majesty.
Much obliged, I&rsquo;m sure!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she walked away with the cow, leaving the
king and Princess Fluff and all the people much
embarrassed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have we any cows in the royal stables?&rdquo; asked
Bud, turning to Tullydub.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, your Majesty; there are several,&rdquo; answered
the chief counselor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Bud, &ldquo;give one of them to the fat
woman and send her home. I&rsquo;ve done all the judging
I am going to do to-day, and now I&rsquo;ll take my
sister upstairs to play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on! Hold on!&rdquo; cried a shrill voice. &ldquo;I
demand justice! Justice of the king! Justice of the
law! Justice to the king&rsquo;s aunt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bud looked down the room and saw Aunt Rivette
struggling with some of the guards. Then she broke
away from them and rushed to the throne, crying
again:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>&ldquo;Justice, your Majesty!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you?&rdquo; asked Bud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Matter? Everything&rsquo;s the matter with me.
Aren&rsquo;t you the new king?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Bud. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I not your aunt? Am I not your aunt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Bud, again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, why am I left to live in a hut and dress in
rags? Doesn&rsquo;t the law say that every blood relation
of the king shall live in a royal palace?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does it?&rdquo; asked Bud, turning to Tullydub.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The law says so, your Majesty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And must I have that old crosspatch around me
all the time?&rdquo; wailed the new king.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crosspatch yourself!&rdquo; screamed Aunt Rivette,
shaking her fist at Bud. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll teach you to crosspatch
me when I get you alone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bud shuddered. Then he turned again to Tullydub.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The king can do what he likes, can&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; the
boy asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, your Majesty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let the lord high executioner step forward!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<div class="img" id="pic25">
<img src="images/i_078_0298.jpg" alt="" width="730" height="982" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;&lsquo;THEN LET THE LORD HIGH EXECUTIONER STEP FORWARD!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Bud! What are you going to do?&rdquo; said
Fluff, seizing him tightly by the arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You let me alone!&rdquo; answered Bud. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not
going to be a king for nothing. And Aunt Rivette
whipped me once&mdash;sixteen hard switches! I counted
&rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The executioner was now bowing before him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get a switch,&rdquo; commanded the king.</p>
<p>The executioner brought a long, slender birch
bough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Bud, &ldquo;you give Aunt Rivette sixteen
good switches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t! Don&rsquo;t, Bud!&rdquo; pleaded Meg.</p>
<p>Aunt Rivette fell on her knees, pale and trembling.
In agony she raised her hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never do it again! Let me off, your Majesty!&rdquo;
she screamed. &ldquo;Let me off this once! I&rsquo;ll never
do it again! Never! Never!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Bud, with a cheery smile. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
let you off this time. But if you don&rsquo;t behave, or if
you interfere with me or Fluff, I&rsquo;ll have the lord high
executioner take charge of you. Just remember I&rsquo;m
the king, and then we&rsquo;ll get along all right. Now
you may go upstairs if you wish to and pick out a
room on the top story. Fluff and I are going to
play.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>With this he laid his crown carefully on the seat
of the throne and threw off his ermine robe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, Fluff! We&rsquo;ve had enough business
for to-day,&rdquo; he said, and dragged the laughing princess
from the room, while Aunt Rivette meekly followed
the lord high steward up the stairs to a comfortable
apartment just underneath the roof.</p>
<p>She was very well satisfied at last; and very soon
she sent for the lord high purse-bearer and demanded
money with which to buy some fine clothes for herself.</p>
<p>This was given her willingly, for the law provided
for the comfort of every relative of the king, and
knowing this, Aunt Rivette fully intended to be the
most comfortable woman in the kingdom of Noland.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="h2line1"><span class="sc">Chapter VII.</span></span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE WINGS OF AUNT RIVETTE.</span></h2>
<p>Bud and Meg had plenty to occupy them in looking
over and admiring their new possessions. First
they went to the princess&rsquo;s rooms, where Fluff ordered
her seven maids to spread out all the beautiful gowns
she had received. And forty of them made quite an
imposing show, I assure you. They were all dainty
and sweet and of rich material, suitable for all occasions,
and of all colors and shades. Of course there
were none with trains, for Margaret, although a princess,
was only a little girl; but the gowns were gay
with bright ribbons and jeweled buttons and clasps;
and each one had its hat and hosiery and slippers to
match.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>After admiring the dresses for a time, they looked
at Bud&rsquo;s new clothes&mdash;twenty suits of velvets, brocades,
and finely woven cloths. Some had diamonds
and precious gems sewn on them for ornaments, while
others were plain; but the poorest suit there was finer
than the boy had ever dreamed of possessing.</p>
<p>There were also many articles of apparel to go
with these suits, such as shoes with diamond buckles,
silken stockings, neck laces, and fine linen; and there
was a beautiful little sword, with a gold scabbard and
a jeweled hilt, that the little king could wear on state
occasions.</p>
<p>However, when the children had examined the
gowns and suits to their satisfaction, they began looking
for other amusement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know, Fluff,&rdquo; said the boy, &ldquo;there isn&rsquo;t
a single toy or plaything in this whole palace?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose the old king didn&rsquo;t care for playthings,&rdquo;
replied Fluff, thoughtfully.</p>
<p>Just then there was a knock at the door, and Aunt
Rivette came hobbling into the room. Her wrinkled
old face was full of eagerness, and in her hands she
clasped the purse of golden coins the lord high purse-bearer
had given her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>&ldquo;See what I&rsquo;ve got!&rdquo; she cried, holding out the
purse. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m going to buy the finest clothes in
all the kingdom! And ride in the king&rsquo;s carriage!
And have a man to wait upon me! And make
Mammy Skib and Mistress Kappleson and all the
other neighbors wild with jealousy!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="pic26">
<img src="images/i_083_0428.jpg" alt="" width="563" height="688" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;AFTER ADMIRING THE DRESSES FOR A TIME, THEY LOOKED AT BUD&rsquo;S NEW CLOTHES.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; said Bud.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you owe everything to me!&rdquo; cried Aunt
Rivette. &ldquo;If I hadn&rsquo;t brought you to Nole on the
donkey&rsquo;s back, you wouldn&rsquo;t have been the forty-seventh
person to enter the gate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; said Meg.</p>
<p>But Bud was angry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but look here, you
mustn&rsquo;t bother us. Just keep out of our way, please,
and let me alone, and then I won&rsquo;t care how many
new dresses you buy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to spend every piece of this gold!&rdquo;
she exclaimed, clasping the purse with her wrinkled
hands. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t like to go through the streets
in this poor dress. Won&rsquo;t you lend me your cloak,
Meg, until I get back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I will,&rdquo; returned the girl; and going
to the closet, she brought out the magic cloak the
fairy had given her and threw it over Aunt Rivette&rsquo;s
shoulders. For she was sorry for the old woman,
and this was the prettiest cloak she had.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<div class="img" id="pic27">
<img src="images/i_085_0429.jpg" alt="" width="733" height="1007" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;ALMOST BEFORE SHE KNEW IT, AUNT RIVETTE HAD DESCENDED
TO THE ROOF OF THE ROYAL STABLES.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>So old Rivette, feeling very proud and anxious to
spend her money, left the palace and walked as fast
as her tottering legs would carry her down the street
in the direction of the shops. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll buy a yellow
silk,&rdquo; she mumbled to herself, half aloud, &ldquo;and a
white velvet, and a purple brocade, and a sky-blue
bonnet with crimson plumes! And won&rsquo;t the neighbors
stare then? Oh, dear! If I could only walk
faster! And the shops are so far! I wish I could
fly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now she was wearing the magic cloak when she
expressed this wish, and no sooner had she spoken
than two great feathery wings appeared, fastened to
her shoulders.</p>
<p>The old woman stopped short, turned her head,
and saw the wings; and then she gave a scream and
a jump and began waving her arms frantically.</p>
<p>The wings flopped at the same time, raising her
slowly from the ground, and she began to soar gracefully
above the heads of the astonished people, who
thronged the streets below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop! Help! Murder!&rdquo; shrieked Rivette, kicking
her feet in great agitation, and at the same time
flopping nervously her new wings. &ldquo;Save me, some
one! Save me!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you save yourself?&rdquo; asked a man
below. &ldquo;Stop flying, if you want to reach the earth
again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This struck old Rivette as a sensible suggestion.
She was quite a distance in the air by this time; but
she tried to hold her wings steady and not flop them,
and the result was that she began to float slowly
downward. Then, with horror, she saw she was
sinking directly upon the branches of a prickly-pear
tree; so she screamed and began flying again, and
the swift movement of her wings sent her high into
the air.</p>
<p>So great was her terror that she nearly fainted;
but she shut her eyes so that she might not see how
high up she was, and held her wings rigid and began
gracefully to float downward again.</p>
<p>By and by she opened her eyes and found one of
her sleeves was just missing the sharp point of a lightning-rod
on a tower of the palace. So she began
struggling and flopping anew, and, almost before she
knew it, Aunt Rivette had descended to the roof of
the royal stables. Here she sat down and began to
weep and wail, while a great crowd gathered below
and watched her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>

<p class="caption">&ldquo;&lsquo;HELP! GET A LADDER!&rsquo; WAILED THE OLD WOMAN.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Get a ladder! <i>Please</i>
get a ladder!&rdquo; begged
old Rivette. &ldquo;If you
don&rsquo;t, I shall fall and break my neck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time Bud and Fluff had come out to see
what caused the excitement; and, to their amazement
they found their old aunt perched high up on the
stable roof, with two great wings growing out from
her back.</p>
<p>For a moment they could not understand what had
happened. Then Margaret cried:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Bud, I let her wear the magic cloak! She
must have made a wish!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help! Help! Get a ladder!&rdquo; wailed the old
woman, catching sight of her nephew and niece.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you <i>are</i> a bird, Aunt Rivette!&rdquo; shouted
Bud, gleefully, for he was in a teasing mood. &ldquo;You
don&rsquo;t need a ladder! I don&rsquo;t see why you can&rsquo;t fly
down the same way you flew up.&rdquo; And all the people
shouted: &ldquo;Yes, yes! The king is right! Fly
down!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then Rivette&rsquo;s feet began to slip on the sloping
roof; so she made a wild struggle to save herself, and
the result was that she fluttered her wings in just
exactly the right way to sink down gradually to the
ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be all right as soon as you know how to
use your wings,&rdquo; said Bud, with a laugh. &ldquo;But where
did you get &rsquo;em, anyhow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Aunt Rivette, much relieved
to be on earth again, and rather pleased to have
attracted so much attention. &ldquo;Are the wings
pretty?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>&ldquo;They are perfectly lovely!&rdquo; cried Fluff, clapping
her hands in glee. &ldquo;Why, Aunt Rivette, I do believe
you must be the only person in all the world who
can fly!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="pic29">

</div>
<p>&ldquo;But I think you look like an overgrown buzzard,&rdquo;
said Bud.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>Now it happened that all this praise, and the wondering
looks of the people, did a great deal to reconcile
Rivette to her new wings. Indeed, she began
to feel a certain pride and distinction in them; and,
finding she had through all the excitement retained
her grasp on the purse of gold, she now wrapped the
magic cloak around her and walked away to the shops,
followed by a crowd of men, women, and children.</p>

<br /><span class="h2line2">THE ROYAL RECEPTION.</span></h2>
<p>As for the king and Princess Fluff, they returned
to the palace and dressed themselves in some of their
prettiest garments, telling Jikki to have two ponies
saddled and ready for them to ride upon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We really <i>must</i> have some toys,&rdquo; said Meg, with
decision; &ldquo;and now that we are rich, there is no reason
why we can&rsquo;t buy what we want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; answered Bud. &ldquo;The old king
hadn&rsquo;t anything to play with. Poor old man! I
wonder what he did to amuse himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They mounted their ponies, and, followed by the
chief counselor and the lord high purse-bearer in one
of the state carriages, and a guard of soldiers for
escort, they rode down the streets of the city on a
pleasure-jaunt, amid the shouts of the loyal populace.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>By and by Bud saw a toy-shop in one of the streets,
and he and Fluff slipped down from their ponies and
went inside to examine the toys. It was a well-stocked
shop, and there were rows upon rows of
beautiful dolls on the shelves, which attracted Margaret&rsquo;s
attention at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Bud,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;I must have one of
these dollies!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take your choice,&rdquo; said her brother, calmly,
although his own heart was beating with delight at
the sight of all the toys arranged before him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know which to choose,&rdquo; sighed the little
princess, looking from one doll to another with longing
and indecision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take &rsquo;em all,&rdquo; declared Bud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All! What&mdash;all these rows of dollies?&rdquo; she
gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; asked the king. Then he turned to
the men who kept the shop and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Call in that old fellow who carries the money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the lord high purse-bearer appeared, Bud
said to him:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>&ldquo;Pay the man for all these dolls; and for this&mdash;and
this&mdash;and this&mdash;and this!&rdquo; and he began picking
out the prettiest toys in all the shop, in the most
reckless way you can imagine.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic30">
<img src="images/i_095_0433.jpg" alt="" width="732" height="608" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;&lsquo;WE&rsquo;LL TAKE &rsquo;EM ALL,&rsquo; DECLARED BUD.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>The soldiers loaded the carriage down with Meg&rsquo;s
dolls, and a big cart was filled with Bud&rsquo;s toys. Then
the purse-bearer paid the bill, although he sighed
deeply several times while counting out the money.
But the new king paid no attention to old Tillydib;
and when the treasures were all secured the children
mounted their ponies and rode joyfully back to the
palace, followed in a procession by the carriage filled
with dolls, and the cart loaded with toys, while Tullydub
and Tillydib, being unable to ride in the carriage,
trotted along at the rear on foot.</p>
<p>Bud had the toys and dolls all carried upstairs into
a big room, and then he ordered everybody to keep
out while he and Fluff arranged their playthings
around the room and upon the tables and chairs,
besides littering the floor so that they could hardly
find a clear place large enough for some of their romping
games.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After all,&rdquo; he said to his sister, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a good thing
to be a king!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or even a princess,&rdquo; added Meg, busily dressing
and arranging her dolls.</p>
<p>They made Jikki bring their dinner to them in the
&ldquo;play-room,&rdquo; as Bud called it; but neither of the children
could spare much time to eat, their treasures
being all so new and delightful.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>Soon after dusk, while Jikki was lighting the candles,
the chief counselor came to the door to say that
the king must be ready to attend the royal reception
in five minutes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Bud. &ldquo;I just won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you <i>must</i>, your Majesty!&rdquo; declared old Tullydub.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I not the king?&rdquo; demanded Bud, looking
up from where he was arranging an army of wooden
soldiers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, your Majesty,&rdquo; was the reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And isn&rsquo;t the king&rsquo;s will the law?&rdquo; continued
Bud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, your Majesty!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if that is so, just understand that I won&rsquo;t
come. Go away and let me alone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the people expect your Majesty to attend the
royal reception,&rdquo; protested old Tullydub, greatly astonished.
&ldquo;It is the usual custom, you know; and they
would be greatly disappointed if your Majesty did
not appear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; said Bud. &ldquo;You get out of here
and let me alone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, your Majesty&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>The king threw a toy cannon at his chief counselor,
and the old man ducked to escape it, and then quickly
closed the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bud,&rdquo; said the princess, softly, &ldquo;you were just saying
it&rsquo;s great fun to be a king.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it is,&rdquo; he answered promptly.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic31">

<p class="caption">&ldquo;THE KING THREW A TOY CANNON AT HIS CHIEF COUNSELOR.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>&ldquo;But father used to tell us,&rdquo; continued the girl, trying
a red hat on a brown-haired doll, &ldquo;that people
in this world always have to pay for any good thing
they get.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; said Bud, with surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean if you&rsquo;re going to be the king, and wear
fine clothes, and eat lovely dinners, and live in a palace,
and have countless servants, and all the playthings
you want, and your own way in everything and with
everybody&mdash;then you ought to be willing to pay for
all these pleasures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How? But how <i>can</i> I pay for them?&rdquo; demanded
Bud, staring at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By attending the royal receptions, and doing all
the disagreeable things the king is expected to do,&rdquo;
she answered.</p>
<p>Bud thought about it for a minute. Then he got
up, walked over to his sister, and kissed her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I b&rsquo;lieve you&rsquo;re right, Fluff,&rdquo; he said, with a sigh.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go to that reception to-night, and take it as I
would take a dose of medicine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you will!&rdquo; returned Fluff, looking up
at him brightly; &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll go with you! The dolls
can wait til to-morrow. Have Jikki brush your
hair, and I&rsquo;ll get my maids to dress me!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>Old Tullydub was wondering how he might best
explain the king&rsquo;s absence to the throng of courtiers
gathered to attend the royal reception, when, to his
surprise and relief, his Majesty entered the room,
accompanied by the Princess Fluff. The king wore
a velvet suit trimmed with gold lace, and at his side
hung the beautiful jeweled sword. Meg was dressed
in a soft white silken gown, and looked as sweet and
fair as a lily.</p>
<p>The courtiers and their ladies, who were all wearing
their most handsome and becoming apparel, received
their little king with great respect, and several
of the wealthiest and most noble among them came
up to Bud to converse with him.</p>
<p>But the king did not know what to say to these
great personages, and so the royal reception began to
be a very stupid affair.</p>
<p>Fluff saw that all the people were standing in stiff
rows and looking at one another uneasily, so she went
to Bud and whispered to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there a band of musicians in the palace?&rdquo; the
king inquired of Tellydeb, who stood near.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, your Majesty.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>&ldquo;Send for them, then,&rdquo; commanded Bud.</p>
<p>Presently the musicians appeared, and the king
ordered them to play a waltz. But the chief counselor
rushed up and exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, your Majesty! This is against all rule and
custom!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; said Bud, angrily. &ldquo;<i>I&rsquo;ll</i> make the
rules and customs in this kingdom hereafter. We&rsquo;re
going to have a dance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s so dreadful&mdash;so unconventional, your
Majesty! It&rsquo;s so&mdash;what shall I call it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here! I&rsquo;ve had enough of this,&rdquo; declared Bud.
&ldquo;You go and stand in that corner, with your face to
the wall, till I tell you to sit down,&rdquo; he added, remembering
a time when his father, the ferryman, had
inflicted a like punishment upon him.</p>
<p>Somewhat to his surprise, Tullydub at once obeyed
the command, and then Bud made his first speech to
the people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to have a dance,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;so pitch
in and have a good time. If there&rsquo;s anything you
want, ask for it. You&rsquo;re all welcome to stay as long
as you please and go home when you get ready.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>This seemed to please the company, for every one
applauded the king&rsquo;s speech. Then the musicians
began to play, and the people were soon dancing and
enjoying themselves greatly.</p>
<p>Princess Fluff had a good many partners that evening,
but Bud did not care to dance&mdash;he preferred to
look on; and, after a time, he brought old Tullydub
out of his corner, and made the chief counselor promise
to be good and not annoy him again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it is my duty to counsel the king,&rdquo; protested
the old man, solemnly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I want your advice I&rsquo;ll ask for it,&rdquo; said
Bud.</p>
<p>While Tullydub stood beside the throne, looking
somewhat sulky and disagreeable, the door opened
and Aunt Rivette entered the reception-room. She
was clothed in a handsome gown of bright-green velvet,
trimmed with red and yellow flowers, and the
wings stuck out from the folds at her back in a way
that was truly wonderful.</p>
<p>Aunt Rivette seemed in an amiable mood. She
smiled and curtsied to all the people, who stopped
dancing to stare at her, and she even fluttered her
wings once or twice to show that she was proud of
being unlike all the others present.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>

<p class="caption">&ldquo;ONE SCREAMED &lsquo;MURDER!&rsquo; AND THE
OTHER &lsquo;HELP!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>Bud had to laugh at her, she looked so funny; and
then a mischievous thought came to him, and he commanded
old Tullydub to dance with her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t dance, your Majesty!&rdquo; exclaimed the
horrified chief counselor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try it; I&rsquo;m sure you can dance,&rdquo; returned Bud.
&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t know how, it&rsquo;s time you learned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the poor man was forced to place his arm about
Aunt Rivette&rsquo;s waist and to whirl her around in a
waltz. The old woman knew as little about dancing
as did Tullydub, and they were exceedingly awkward,
bumping into every one they came near. Presently
Aunt Rivette&rsquo;s feet slipped, and she would have
tumbled upon the floor with the chief counselor had
she not begun to flutter her wings wildly.</p>
<p>So, instead of falling, she rose gradually into the
air, carrying Tullydub with her; for they clung to
each other in terror, and one screamed &ldquo;Murder!&rdquo;
and the other &ldquo;Help!&rdquo; in their loudest voices.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>Bud laughed until the tears stood in his eyes; but
Aunt Rivette, after bumping both her own head and
that of the chief counselor against the ceiling several
times, finally managed to control the action of her
wings and to descend to the floor again.</p>
<p>As soon as he was released, old Tullydub fled from
the room; and Aunt Rivette, vowing she would dance
no more, seated herself beside Bud and watched the
revel until nearly midnight, when the couriers and
their ladies dispersed to their own homes declaring
that they had never enjoyed a more delightful evening.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>

<p class="caption">&ldquo;JIKKI HAD TO DESCEND THE STAIRS CAUTIOUSLY.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="h2line1"><span class="sc">Chapter IX.</span></span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">JIKKI HAS A WISH GRANTED.</span></h2>
<p>Next morning Aunt Rivette summoned Jikki to
her room, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take these shoes and clean and polish them; and
carry down this tray of breakfast dishes; and send
this hat to the milliner to have the feathers curled; and
return this cloak to the Princess Fluff, with my compliments,
and say I&rsquo;m much obliged for the loan of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poor Jikki hardly knew how to manage so many
orders. He took the shoes in his left hand, and the
tray of dishes he balanced upon the other upraised
palm. But the hat and cloak were too many for him.
So Aunt Rivette, calling him &ldquo;a stupid idiot,&rdquo;&mdash;probably
because he had no more hands,&mdash;set the
plumed hat upon Jikki&rsquo;s head and spread the cloak
over his shoulders, and ordered him to make haste
away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>Jikki was glad enough to go, for the fluttering of
Aunt Rivette&rsquo;s wings made him nervous; but he had
to descend the stairs cautiously, for the hat was tipped
nearly over his eyes, and if he stumbled he would be
sure to spill the tray of dishes.</p>
<p>He reached the first landing of the broad stairs in
safety, but at the second landing the hat joggled forward
so that he could see nothing at all, and one of
the shoes dropped from his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; sighed the old man; &ldquo;I wonder what
I shall do now? If I pick up the shoe I shall drop
the dishes; and I can&rsquo;t set down this tray because
I&rsquo;m blinded by this terrible hat! Dear&mdash;dear! If
I&rsquo;m to be at the beck and call of that old woman, and
serve the new king at the same time, I shall have my
hands full. My hands, in fact, are full now. I really
wish I had half a dozen servants to wait on <i>me</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jikki knew nothing at all about the magic power
of the cloak that fell from his shoulders; so his astonishment
was profound when some one seized the shoe
from his left hand and some one else removed the
tray from his right hand, and still another person
snatched the plumed hat from his head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>But then he saw, bowing and smirking before him,
six young men, who looked as much alike as peas in
the same pod, and all of whom wore very neat and
handsome liveries of wine-color, with silver buttons
on their coats.</p>
<p>Jikki blinked and stared at these people, and rubbed
his eyes to make sure he was awake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; he managed to ask.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are your half a dozen servants, sir,&rdquo; answered
the young men, speaking all together and bowing
again.</p>
<p>Jikki gasped and raised his hands with sudden
amazement as he gazed in wonder upon the row of
six smart servants.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;what&mdash;are you doing here?&rdquo; he stammered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are here to wait upon you, sir, as is our duty,&rdquo;
they answered respectfully.</p>
<p>Jikki rubbed his left ear, as was his custom when
perplexed; and then he thought it all over. And
the more he thought the more perplexed he became.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand!&rdquo; he finally said, in a weak
voice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<div class="img" id="pic34">
<img src="images/i_111_0546.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="322" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;&lsquo;YOU WISHED FOR US, AND
HERE WE ARE,&rsquo; DECLARED THE SIX.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;You wished for us, and here we are,&rdquo; declared
the six, once more bowing low before him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Jikki. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve often wished for
many other things&mdash;and never got a single one of
the wishes before!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>The young men did not attempt to explain this curious
fact. They stood in a straight row before their
master, as if awaiting his orders. One held the shoe
Jikki had dropped, another its mate, still another the
plumed hat, and a fourth the tray of dishes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; remarked Jikki, shaking his head sadly
at the six, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m only a servant myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are our master, sir!&rdquo; announced the young
men, their voices blended into one.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wish,&rdquo; said Jikki, solemnly, &ldquo;you were all back
where you came from!&rdquo; And then he paused to see
if his wish also would be fulfilled. But no; the
magic cloak conferred the fulfilment of but one wish
upon its wearer, and the half a dozen servants remained
standing rigidly before him.</p>
<p>Jikki arose with a sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come downstairs to my private room,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;and we&rsquo;ll talk the matter over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they descended the grand stairway to the main
hall of the grand palace, Jikki going first and his
servants following at a respectful distance. Just off
the hall Jikki had a pleasant room where he could
sit when not employed, and into this he led the
six.</p>
<p>After all, he considered, it would not be a bad thing
to have half a dozen servants; they would save his old
legs from many a tiresome errand. But just as they
reached the hall a new thought struck him and he
turned suddenly upon his followers:</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;How much wages
do you fellows expect?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We expect no wages at all, sir,&rdquo; they answered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>&ldquo;What! nothing at all!&rdquo; Jikki was so startled that
he scarcely had strength remaining to stagger into his
private room and sink into a chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No wages! Six servants, and no wages to pay!&rdquo;
he muttered. &ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s wonderful&mdash;marvelous&mdash;astounding!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he thought to himself: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try &rsquo;em, and see
if they&rsquo;ll really work.&rdquo; And aloud he asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can I tell you apart&mdash;one from another?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Each servant raised his right arm and pointed to a
silver badge upon his left breast; and then Jikki discovered
that they were all numbered, from &ldquo;one&rdquo; up
to &ldquo;six.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! very good!&rdquo; said Jikki. &ldquo;Now, number
six, take this shoe into the boot-room, and clean and
polish it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Number six bowed and glided from the room as
swiftly and silently as if he were obeying a command
of the King of Noland.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Number five,&rdquo; continued Jikki, &ldquo;take this tray to
the kitchen.&rdquo; Number five obeyed instantly, and
Jikki chuckled with delight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Number two, take this to the milliner in Royal
Street, and have the feathers curled.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>Number two bowed and departed almost before
the words had left Jikki&rsquo;s mouth; and then the king&rsquo;s
valet regarded the remaining three in some perplexity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Half a dozen servants is almost too many,&rdquo; he
thought. &ldquo;It will keep me busy to keep them busy.
I should have wished for only one&mdash;or two at the
most.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then he remembered something.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Number four,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;go after number two
and tell the milliner that the hat belongs to Madam
Rivette, the king&rsquo;s aunt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And a few moments later, when the remaining two
servants, standing upright before him, had begun to
make him nervous, Jikki cried out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Number three, take this other shoe down to the
boot-room and tell number six to clean and polish it
also.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This left but one of the six unoccupied, and Jikki
was wondering what to do with him when a bell rang.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the king&rsquo;s bell,&rdquo; said Jikki.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not the king&rsquo;s servant; I am here only to
wait upon you,&rdquo; said number one, without moving to
answer the bell.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then I must go myself,&rdquo; sighed the valet, and
rushed away to obey the king&rsquo;s summons.</p>
<p>Scarcely had he disappeared when Tollydob, the
lord high general, entered the room and said in a
gruff voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is Jikki? Where&rsquo;s that rascal Jikki?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Number one, standing stiffly at one end of the room,
made no reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Answer me, you scoundrel!&rdquo; roared the old general.
&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Jikki?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still number one stood silent, and this so enraged
old Tollydob that he raised his cane and aimed a
furious blow at the young man. The cane seemed
to pass directly through the fellow, and it struck
the wall behind so forcibly that it split into two
parts.</p>
<p>This amazed Tollydob. He stared a moment at
the silent servant, and then turned his back upon
him and sat down in Jikki&rsquo;s chair. Here his eyes
fell upon the magic cloak, which the king&rsquo;s valet had
thrown down.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>Tollydob, attracted by the gorgeous coloring and
soft texture of the garment, picked up the cloak and
threw it over his shoulders; and then he walked to
a mirror and began admiring his reflection.</p>
<p>While thus engaged, Jikki returned, and the valet
was so startled at seeing the lord high general that
he never noticed the cloak at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His Majesty has asked to see your Highness,&rdquo;
said Jikki; &ldquo;and I was about to go in search of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go to the king at once,&rdquo; answered Tollydob,
and as he walked away Jikki suddenly noticed that
he was wearing the cloak. &ldquo;Oho!&rdquo; thought the
valet, &ldquo;he has gone off with the Princess Fluff&rsquo;s pretty
cloak; but when he returns from the king&rsquo;s chamber
I&rsquo;ll get it again and send number one to carry it to
its rightful owner.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="h2line1"><span class="sc">Chapter X.</span></span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE COUNSELORS WEAR THE MAGIC CLOAK.</span></h2>
<p>When Tollydob, still wearing the magic cloak, had
bowed before the king, Bud asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many men are there in the royal army,
general?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seven thousand seven hundred and seventy-seven,
may it please your gracious Majesty,&rdquo; returned Tollydob&mdash;&ldquo;that
is, without counting myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do they obey your orders promptly?&rdquo; inquired
Bud, who felt a little doubt on this point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed!&rdquo; answered the general, proudly.
&ldquo;They are terribly afraid of my anger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet you&rsquo;re a very small man to command
so large an army,&rdquo; said the king.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>The lord high general flushed with shame; for,
although he was both old and fat, he was so short of
stature that he stood but a trifle taller than Bud himself.
And, like all short men, he was very sensitive
about his height.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a terrible fighter, your Majesty,&rdquo; declared
Tollydob, earnestly; &ldquo;and when I&rsquo;m on horseback
my small size is little noticed. Nevertheless,&rdquo; he
added, with a sigh, &ldquo;it is a good thing to be tall. I
wish I were ten feet high.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No sooner were the words spoken than Bud gave
a cry of astonishment; for the general&rsquo;s head shot
suddenly upward until his gorgeous hat struck the
ceiling and was jammed down tightly over the startled
man&rsquo;s eyes and nose.</p>
<p>The room was just ten feet high, and Tollydob
was now ten feet tall; but for a time the old general
could not think what had happened to him, and Bud,
observing for the first time that Tollydob wore the
magic cloak, began to shriek with laughter at the
comical result of the old man&rsquo;s wish.</p>
<p>Hearing the king laugh, the general tore the hat
from his head and looked at himself in mingled terror
and admiration.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>From being a very small man he had suddenly
become a giant, and the change was so great that
Tollydob might well be amazed.</p>

<p class="caption">&ldquo;&lsquo;I WISH I WERE TEN FEET HIGH.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What has happened, your Majesty?&rdquo; he asked
in a trembling voice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, don&rsquo;t you see, you were wearing my sister&rsquo;s
magic cloak,&rdquo; said Bud, still laughing at the big man&rsquo;s
woeful face; &ldquo;and it grants to every wearer the fulfillment
of one wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only one?&rdquo; inquired poor Tollydob. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like
to be a little smaller, I confess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be helped now,&rdquo; said Bud. &ldquo;You wished
to be ten feet tall, and there you are! And there
you&rsquo;ll have to stay, Tollydob, whether you like it or
not. But I&rsquo;m very proud of you. You must be the
greatest general in all the world, you know!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tollydob brightened up at this, and tried to sit
down in a chair: but it crushed to pieces under his
weight; so he sighed and remained standing. Then
he threw the magic cloak upon the floor, with a little
shudder at its fairy powers, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I&rsquo;d only known, I might have become just six
feet tall instead of ten!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; said Bud, consolingly. &ldquo;If we ever
have a war, you will strike terror into the ranks of
the enemy, and every one in Noland will admire you
immensely. Hereafter you will be not only the lord
high general, but the lord <i>very</i> high general.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>So Tollydob went away to show himself to the
chief counselor; and he had to stoop very low to pass
through the doorway.</p>
<p>When Jikki saw the gigantic man coming out of
the king&rsquo;s chamber, he gave a scream and fled in terror;
and, strange to say, this effect was very agreeable
to the lord high general, who loved to make people
fear him.</p>
<p>Bud ran to tell Fluff of the curious thing that had
happened to his general; and so it was that when
the lord high executioner entered the palace there
was no one around to receive him. He made his
way into the king&rsquo;s chamber, and there he found the
magic cloak lying upon the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen the Princess Fluff wearing this,&rdquo; thought
the lord high executioner; &ldquo;so it must belong to her.
I&rsquo;ll take it to her rooms, for it is far too pretty to be
lying around in this careless way, and Jikki ought to
be scolded for allowing it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Tellydeb picked up the cloak and laid it over
his arm; then he admired the bright hues that ran
through the fabric, and presently his curiosity got the
better of him; he decided to try it on and see how
he would look in it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>While thus employed the sound of a girl&rsquo;s sweet
laughter fell upon Tellydeb&rsquo;s ears, seeming to come
from a far distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The princess must be in the royal gardens,&rdquo; he
said to himself. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go there and find her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the lord high executioner walked through the
great hall, still wearing the cloak, and finally came to
the back of the palace and passed a doorway leading
into the gardens. All was quiet here, save for the
song of the birds as they fluttered among the trees;
but at the other end of the garden Tellydeb caught
a glimpse of a white gown, which he suspected might
be that of the little princess.</p>
<p>He walked along the paths slowly, enjoying the
scent of the flowers and the peacefulness of the scene;
for the lord high executioner was a gentle-natured
man and delighted in beautiful sights.</p>
<p>After a time he reached a fruit-orchard, and saw
hanging far up in a big tree a fine red apple. Tellydeb
paused and looked at this longingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could reach that apple!&rdquo; he said, with
a sigh, as he extended his arm upward.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>Instantly the arm stretched toward the apple, which
was at least forty feet away from the lord high executioner;
and while the astonished man eyed his elongated
arm in surprise, the hand clutched the apple,
plucked it, and drew it back to him; and there he
stood&mdash;the apple in his hand, and his arm apparently
the same as it had been before he accomplished the
wonderful feat.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic36">
<img src="images/i_123_0549.jpg" alt="" width="738" height="604" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;&lsquo;I WISH I COULD REACH THAT APPLE!&rsquo; HE SAID, WITH A SIGH, AS HE EXTENDED HIS ARM UPWARD.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>For a moment the counselor was overcome with
fear. The cloak dropped unnoticed from his shoulders
and fell upon the graveled walk, while Tellydeb
sank upon a bench and shivered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&mdash;it was like magic!&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;I but
reached out my hand&mdash;so&mdash;it went nearly to the
top of the tree, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here he gave a cry of wonder, for again his arm
stretched the distance and touched the topmost
branches of the tree. He drew it back hastily, and
turned to see if any one had observed him. But this
part of the garden was deserted, so the old man
eagerly tested his new accomplishment.</p>
<p>He plucked a rose from a bush a dozen yards to
the right, and having smelled its odor he placed it
in a vase that stood twenty feet to his left. Then he
noted a fountain far across a hedge, and reaching the
distance easily, dipped his hand in the splashing
water. It was all very amazing, this sudden power
to reach a great distance, and the lord high executioner
was so pleased with the faculty that when he
discovered old Jikki standing in the palace doorway,
he laughingly fetched him a box on the ear that sent
the valet scampering away to his room in amazed
terror.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>Said Tellydeb to himself: &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ll go home and
show my wife what a surprising gift I have acquired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he left the garden; and not long afterward old
Tallydab, the lord high steward, came walking down
the path, followed by his little dog Ruffles. I am
not certain whether it was because his coat was so
shaggy or his temper so uncertain that Tallydab&rsquo;s
dog was named Ruffles; but the name fitted well both
the looks and the disposition of the tiny animal.
Nevertheless, the lord high steward was very fond
of his dog, which followed him everywhere except to
the king&rsquo;s council-chamber; and often the old man
would tell Ruffles his troubles and worries, and talk
to the dog just as one would to a person.</p>
<p>To-day, as they came slowly down the garden-walk,
Tallydab noticed a splendid cloak lying upon
the path.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How very beautiful!&rdquo; he exclaimed, as he stooped
to pick it up. &ldquo;I have never seen anything like this
since the Princess Fluff first rode into Nole beside
her brother the king. Isn&rsquo;t it a lovely cloak, Ruffles?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>The dog gave a subdued yelp and wagged his
stubby tail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do I look in it, Ruffles?&rdquo; continued the
lord high steward, wrapping the folds of the magic
cloak about him; &ldquo;how do I look in such gorgeous
apparel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dog stopped wagging its tail and looked up at
its master earnestly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do I look?&rdquo; again said Tallydab. &ldquo;I declare,
I wish you could talk!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You look perfectly ridiculous,&rdquo; replied the dog,
in a rather harsh voice.</p>
<p>The lord high steward jumped nearly three feet in
the air, so startled was he by Ruffles&rsquo;s reply. Then
he bent down, a hand on each knee, and regarded
the dog curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought, at first, you had spoken!&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What caused you to change your mind?&rdquo; asked
Ruffles, peevishly. &ldquo;I <i>did</i> speak&mdash;I <i>am</i> speaking.
Can&rsquo;t you believe it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lord high steward drew a deep sigh of conviction.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<div class="img" id="pic37">
<img src="images/i_127_0551.jpg" alt="" width="736" height="1009" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;&lsquo;YOU LOOK PERFECTLY RIDICULOUS!&rsquo; REPLIED THE DOG.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>&ldquo;I believe it!&rdquo; he made answer. &ldquo;I have always
declared you were a wonderful dog, and now you
prove I am right. Why, you are the only dog I ever
heard of who could talk!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Except in fairy tales,&rdquo; said Ruffles, calmly.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget the fairy tales.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t forget,&rdquo; replied Tallydab. &ldquo;But this isn&rsquo;t
a fairy tale, Ruffles. It&rsquo;s real life in the kingdom of
Noland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure,&rdquo; answered Ruffles. &ldquo;But see here,
my dear master: now that I am, at last, able to talk,
please allow me to ask you for something decent to
eat. I&rsquo;d like a good meal for once, just to see what
it is like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good meal!&rdquo; exclaimed the steward. &ldquo;Why,
my friend, don&rsquo;t I give you a big bone every day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do,&rdquo; said the dog; &ldquo;and I nearly break my
teeth on it, trying to crack it to get a little marrow.
Whatever induces people to give their dogs bones
instead of meat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I thought you liked bones!&rdquo; protested Tallydab,
sitting on the bench and looking at his dog in
astonishment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t. I prefer something to eat&mdash;something
good and wholesome, such as you eat yourself,&rdquo;
growled Ruffles.</p>
<p>The lord high steward gave a laugh.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic38">
<img src="images/i_130_0553.jpg" alt="" width="739" height="613" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;&lsquo;WHY, I THOUGHT YOU LIKED BONES!&rsquo; PROTESTED TALLYDAB, SITTING ON THE BENCH AND
LOOKING AT HIS DOG IN ASTONISHMENT.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you remember that old
Mother Hubbard?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! that <i>was</i> a fairy tale,&rdquo; interrupted Ruffles,
impatiently. &ldquo;And there wasn&rsquo;t even a bone in her
cupboard, after all. Don&rsquo;t mention Mother Hubbard
to me, if you want to retain my friendship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that reminds me,&rdquo; resumed the steward with
a scowl, &ldquo;that a few minutes ago you said I looked
ridiculous in this lovely cloak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do!&rdquo; said Ruffles, with a sniff. &ldquo;It is a girl&rsquo;s
cloak, and not fit for a wrinkled old man like you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you are right,&rdquo; answered Tallydab, with
a sigh; and he removed the cloak from his shoulders
and hung it over the back of the garden seat. &ldquo;In
regard to the meat that you so long for,&rdquo; he added,
&ldquo;if you will follow me to the royal kitchen I will see
that you have all you desire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spoken like a good friend!&rdquo; exclaimed the dog.
&ldquo;Let us go at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they passed down the garden to the kitchen
door, and the magic cloak, which had wrought such
wonderful things that day, still remained neglectfully
cast aside.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>It was growing dusk when old Tillydib, the lord
high purse-bearer, stole into the garden and sat upon
the bench to smoke his pipe in peace. All the afternoon
he had been worried by people with bills for
this thing or that, and the royal purse was very light
indeed when Tillydib had at last managed to escape
to the garden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If this keeps up,&rdquo; he reflected, &ldquo;there will be no
money left; and then I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know what
will become of us all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The air was chilly. The old counselor shivered a
little, and noting the cloak that lay over the back of
the seat, drew it about his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be five months,&rdquo; he muttered half aloud,
&ldquo;before we can tax the people for more money; and
before five months are up the king and his counselors
may all starve to death&mdash;even in this splendid palace!
Heigh-ho! I wish the royal purse would
always remain full, no matter how much money I
drew from it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The big purse, which had lain lightly on his knee,
now slid off and pulled heavily upon the golden chain
which the old man wore around his neck to fasten
the purse to him securely.</p>
<p>Aroused from his anxious thoughts, Tillydib lifted
the purse to his lap again, and was astonished to feel
its weight. He opened the clasp and saw that the
huge sack was actually running over with gold
pieces.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<div class="img" id="pic39">
<img src="images/i_133_0554.jpg" alt="" width="737" height="620" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;&lsquo;I WISH THE ROYAL PURSE WOULD ALWAYS REMAIN FULL, NO MATTER HOW MUCH MONEY I DREW FROM IT!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now, where on earth did all this wealth come
from?&rdquo; he exclaimed, shaking his head in a puzzled
way. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go at once and pay some of the creditors
who are waiting for me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>So he ran to the royal treasury, which was a front
room in the palace, and began paying every one who
presented an account. He expected presently to
empty the purse; but no matter how heavily he drew
upon the contents, it remained ever as full as in the
beginning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be,&rdquo; thought the old man, when the last
bill had been paid, &ldquo;that my idle wish has in some
mysterious way been granted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he did not know he owed his good fortune to
the magic cloak, which he still wore.</p>
<p>As he was leaving the room, he met the king and
Princess Fluff, who were just come from dinner; and
the girl exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, there is my cloak! Where did you get it,
Tillydib?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I found it in the garden,&rdquo; answered the lord high
purse-bearer; &ldquo;but take it, if it is yours. And here
is something to repay you for the loan of it;&rdquo; and he
poured into her hands a heap of glittering gold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, thank you!&rdquo; cried Fluff; and taking the precious
cloak she dropped the gold into it and carried
it to her room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never lend it again unless it is really necessary,&rdquo;
she said to herself. &ldquo;It was very careless of
Aunt Rivette to leave my fairy cloak in the garden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then after carefully folding it and wrapping
it up she locked it in a drawer, and hid the key
where no one but herself could find it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<div class="img" id="pic40">
<img src="images/i_136_0668.jpg" alt="" width="622" height="843" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;THIS WAS THE MOMENT QUAVO HAD EAGERLY AWAITED.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="h2line1"><span class="sc">Chapter XI.</span></span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE WITCH-QUEEN.</span></h2>
<p>It is not very far from the kingdom of Noland to
the kingdom of Ix. If you followed the steps of
Quavo the minstrel, you would climb the sides of a
steep mountain-range, and go down on the other side,
and cross a broad and swift river, and pick your way
through a dark forest. You would then have reached
the land of Ix and would find an easy path into the
big city.</p>
<p>But even before one came to the city he would see
the high marble towers of Queen Zixi&rsquo;s magnificent
palace, and pause to wonder at its beauty.</p>
<p>Quavo the minstrel had been playing his harp in
the city of Nole, and his eyes were sharp; so he had
seen many things to gossip and sing about, and therefore
never doubted he would be warmly welcomed
by Queen Zixi.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>He reached the marble palace about dusk, one
evening, and was bidden to the feast which was about
to be served.</p>
<p>A long table ran down the length of the lofty hall
built in the center of the palace; and this table was
covered with gold and silver platters bearing many
kinds of meats and fruits and vegetables, while tall,
ornamented stands contained sweets and delicacies to
tickle the palate.</p>
<p>At the head of the table, on a jeweled throne, sat
Queen Zixi herself, a vision of radiant beauty and
charming grace.</p>
<p>Her hair was yellow as spun gold, and her wondrous
eyes raven black in hue. Her skin was fair
as a lily, save where her cheek was faintly tinted with
a flush of rose-color.</p>
<p>Dainty and lovely, indeed, was the Queen of Ix in
appearance; yet none of her lords or attendants cast
more than a passing glance upon her beauty. For
they were used to seeing her thus.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>There were graybeards at her table this evening
who could remember the queen&rsquo;s rare beauty since
they were boys; ay, and who had been told by their
fathers and grandfathers of Queen Zixi&rsquo;s loveliness
when they also were mere children. In fact, no one
in Ix had ever heard of the time when the land was
not ruled by this same queen, or when she was not
in appearance as young and fair as she was to-day.
Which easily proves she was not an ordinary person
at all.</p>
<p>And I may as well tell you here that Queen Zixi,
despite the fact that she looked to be no more than
sixteen, was in reality six hundred and eighty-three
years of age, and had prolonged her life in this extraordinary
way by means of the arts of witchcraft.</p>
<p>I do not mean by this that she was an evil person.
She had always ruled her kingdom wisely and liberally,
and the people of Ix made no manner of complaint
against their queen. If there were a war, she
led her armies in person, clad in golden mail and
helmet; and in years of peace she taught them to
sow and reap grain, and to fashion many useful articles
of metal, and to build strong and substantial
houses. Nor were her taxes ever more than the people
could bear.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>Yet, for all this, Zixi was more feared than loved;
for every one remembered she was a witch, and also
knew she was hundreds of years old. So, no matter
how amiable their queen might be, she was always
treated with extreme respect, and folks weighed well
their words when they conversed with her.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic41">
<img src="images/i_140_0669.jpg" alt="" width="704" height="525" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;&lsquo;STOP!&rsquo; CRIED THE QUEEN, WITH SUDDEN EXCITEMENT.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Next the queen, on both sides of the table, sat her
most favored nobles and their ladies; farther down
were the rich merchants and officers of the army; and
at the lower end were servants and members of the
household. For this was the custom in the land of Ix.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>Quavo the harpist sat near the lower end; and,
when all had been comfortably fed, the queen called
upon him for a song. This was the moment Quavo
had eagerly awaited. He took his harp, seated himself
in a niche of the wall, and, according to the manner
of ancient minstrels, he sang of the things he had
seen in other lands, thus serving his hearers with the
news of the day as well as pleasing them with his
music. This is the way he began:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Of Noland now a tale I&rsquo;ll sing,</p>
<p class="t0">Where reigns a strangely youthful king&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">A boy, who has by chance alone</p>
<p class="t0">Been called to sit upon a throne.</p>
<p class="t0">His sister shares his luck, and she</p>
<p class="t0">The fairies&rsquo; friend is said to be;</p>
<p class="t0">For they did mystic arts invoke</p>
<p class="t0">And weave for her a magic cloak</p>
<p class="t0">Which grants its wearer&mdash;thus I&rsquo;m told&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">Gifts more precious far than gold.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;She&rsquo;s but to wish, and her desire</p>
<p class="t0">Quite instantly she will acquire;</p>
<p class="t0">And when she lends it to her friends,</p>
<p class="t0">The favor unto them extends.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;For one who wears the cloak can fly</p>
<p class="t0">Like any eagle in the sky.</p>
<p class="t0">And one did wish, by sudden freak,</p>
<p class="t0">His dog be granted power to speak;</p>
<p class="t0">And now the beast can talk as well</p>
<p class="t0">As I, and also read and spell.</p>
<p class="t0">And&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; cried the queen, with sudden excitement.
&ldquo;Do you lie, minstrel, or are you speaking the truth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Secretly glad that his news was received thus eagerly,
Quavo continued to twang the harp as he replied
in verse:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Now may I die at break of day,</p>
<p class="t0">If false is any word I say.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;And what is this cloak like&mdash;and who owns it?&rdquo;
demanded the queen, impetuously.</p>
<p>Sang the minstrel:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;The cloak belongs to Princess Fluff;</p>
<p class="t0">&rsquo;Tis woven of some secret stuff</p>
<p class="t0">Which makes it gleam with splendor bright</p>
<p class="t0">That fills beholders with delight.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Thereafter the beautiful Zixi remained lost in
thought, her dainty chin resting within the hollow
of her hand and her eyes dreamily fixed upon the
minstrel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<div class="img" id="pic42">
<img src="images/i_143_0670.jpg" alt="" width="695" height="863" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;SHE MADE A SOLEMN VOW THAT SHE WOULD SECURE THE MAGIC CLOAK WITHIN A YEAR.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p>And Quavo, judging that his news had brought
him into rare favor, told more and more wonderful
tales of the magic cloak, some of which were true,
while others were mere inventions of his own; for
newsmongers, as every one knows, were ever unable
to stick to facts since the world began.</p>
<p>All the courtiers and officers and servants listened
with wide eyes and parted lips to the song, marveling
greatly at what they had heard. And when it was
finally ended, and the evening far spent, Queen Zixi
threw a golden chain to the minstrel as a reward and
left the hall, attended by her maidens.</p>
<p>Throughout the night which followed, she tossed
sleeplessly upon her bed, thinking of the magic cloak
and longing to possess it. And when the morning
sun rose over the horizon, she made a solemn vow
that she would secure the magic cloak within a year,
even if it cost her the half of her kingdom.</p>
<p>Now the reason for this rash vow, showing Zixi&rsquo;s
intense desire to possess the cloak, was very peculiar.
Although she had been an adept at witchcraft for
more than six hundred years, and was able to retain
her health and remain in appearance young and beautiful,
there was one thing her art was unable to deceive,
and that one thing was a mirror.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<div class="img" id="pic43">
<img src="images/i_145_0671.jpg" alt="" width="730" height="981" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;QUEEN ZIXI LEFT THE HALL ATTENDED BY HER MAIDENS.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>To mortal eyes Zixi was charming and attractive;
yet her reflection in a mirror showed to her an ugly
old hag, bald of head, wrinkled, with toothless gums
and withered, sunken cheeks.</p>
<p>For this reason the queen had no mirror of any
sort about the palace. Even from her own dressing-room
the mirror had been banished, and she depended
upon her maids and hair-dressers to make her look
as lovely as possible. She knew she was beautiful
in appearance to others; her maids declared it continually,
and in all eyes she truly read admiration.</p>
<p>But Zixi wanted to admire herself; and that was
impossible so long as the cold mirrors showed her
reflection to be the old hag others would also have
seen had not her arts of witchcraft deceived them.</p>
<p>Everything else a woman and a queen might
desire Zixi was able to obtain by her arts. Yet the
one thing she could <i>not</i> have made her very unhappy.</p>
<p>As I have already said, she was not a bad queen.
She used her knowledge of sorcery to please her own
fancy or to benefit her kingdom, but never to injure
any one else. So she may be forgiven for wanting
to see a beautiful girl reflected in a mirror, instead
of a haggard old woman in her six hundred and
eighty-fourth year.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>Zixi had given up all hope of ever accomplishing
her object until she heard of the magic cloak. The
powers of witches are somewhat limited; but she
knew that the powers of fairies are boundless. So
if the magic cloak could grant any human wish, as
Quavo&rsquo;s song had told her was the case, she would
manage to secure it and would at once wish for a
reflection in the mirror of the same features all others
beheld&mdash;and then she would become happy and
content.</p>

<br /><span class="h2line2">ZIXI DISGUISES HERSELF.</span></h2>
<p>Now, as might be expected, Queen Zixi lost no
time in endeavoring to secure the magic cloak. The
people of Ix were not on friendly terms with the people
of Noland; so she could not visit Princess Fluff
openly; and she knew it was useless to try to borrow
so priceless a treasure as a cloak which had been the
gift of the fairies. But one way remained to her&mdash;to
steal the precious robe.</p>
<p>So she began her preparations by telling her people
she would be absent from Ix for a month, and
then she retired to her own room and mixed, by the
rules of witchcraft, a black mess in a silver kettle, and
boiled it until it was as thick as molasses. Of this
inky mixture she swallowed two teaspoonfuls every
hour for six hours, muttering an incantation each
time. At the end of the six hours her golden hair
had become brown and her black eyes had become
blue; and this was quite sufficient to disguise the
pretty queen so that no one would recognize her.
Then she took off her richly embroidered queenly
robes, and hung them up in a closet, putting on a
simple gingham dress, a white apron, and a plain hat
such as common people of her country wore.</p>

<p class="caption">&ldquo;OF THIS INKY MIXTURE SHE SWALLOWED TWO TEASPOONFULS EVERY HOUR FOR SIX HOURS.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>When these preparations had been made, Zixi
slipped out the back door of the palace and walked
through the city to the forest; and, although she met
many people, no one suspected that she was the queen.</p>
<p>It was rough walking in the forest; but she got
through at last, and reached the bank of the river.
Here a fisherman was found, who consented to ferry
her across in his boat; and afterward Zixi climbed
the high mountain and came down the other side into
the kingdom of Noland.</p>
<p>She rented a neat little cottage just at the north
gateway of the city of Nole, and by the next morning
there was a sign over the doorway which announced:</p>
<p class="center">MISS TRUST&rsquo;S
<br />ACADEMY OF WITCHERY
<br />FOR YOUNG LADIES.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<p>Then Zixi had printed on green paper a lot of
handbills which read as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Miss Trust</span>,</p>
<p>A pupil of the celebrated Professor Hatrack
of Hooktown-on-the-Creek, is now located at
Woodbine Villa (North Gateway of Nole),
and is prepared to teach the young ladies of
this city the <i>Arts of Witchcraft</i> according
to the most modern and approved methods.
Terms moderate. References required.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These handbills she hired a little boy to carry to
all the aristocratic houses in Nole, and to leave one
on each door-step. Several were left on the different
door-steps of the palace, and one of these came to the
notice of Princess Fluff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How funny!&rdquo; she exclaimed on reading it. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
go, and take all my eight maids with me. It will be
no end of fun to learn to be a witch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many other people in Nole applied for instruction
in &ldquo;Miss Trust&rsquo;s Academy,&rdquo; but Zixi told them all
she had no vacancies. When, however, Fluff and her
maids arrived, she welcomed them with the utmost
cordiality, and consented to give them their first lesson
at once.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>When she had seated them in her parlor, Zixi said:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;If you wish to be a witch,</p>
<p class="t">You must speak an incantation:</p>
<p class="t">You must with deliberation</p>
<p class="t0">Say: &lsquo;The when of why is which!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;What does that mean?&rdquo; asked Fluff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one knows,&rdquo; answered Zixi; &ldquo;and therefore
it is a fine incantation. Now, all the class will please
repeat after me the following words:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Erig-a-ma-role, erig-a-ma-ree;</p>
<p class="t0">Jig-ger-nut, jog-ger-nit, que-jig-ger-ee.</p>
<p class="t0">Sim-mer-kin, sam-mer-kin, sem-mer-ga-roo;</p>
<p class="t0">Zil-li-pop, zel-li-pop, lol-li-pop-loo!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>They tried to do this, but their tongues stumbled
constantly over the syllables, and one of the maids
began to laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop laughing, please!&rdquo; cried Zixi, rapping her
ruler on the table. &ldquo;This is no laughing matter, I
assure you, young ladies. The science of witchcraft
is a solemn and serious study, and I cannot teach it
you unless you behave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what&rsquo;s it all about?&rdquo; asked Fluff.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll explain what it&rsquo;s about to-morrow,&rdquo; said Zixi,
with dignity. &ldquo;Now, here are two important incantations
which you must learn by heart before you come
to to-morrow&rsquo;s lesson. If you can speak them correctly
and rapidly, and above all very distinctly, I will
then allow you to perform a wonderful witchery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She handed them each a slip of paper on which
were written the incantations, as follows:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="tc">Incantation No. 1.</p>
<p class="tc">(To be spoken only in the presence of a black cat.)</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">This is that, and that is this;</p>
<p class="t0">Bliss is blest, and blest is bliss.</p>
<p class="t0">Who is that, and what is who;</p>
<p class="t0">Shed is shod, and shud is shoe!</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="tc">Incantation No. 2.</p>
<p class="tc">(To be spoken when the clock strikes twelve.)</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">What is which, and which is what;</p>
<p class="t0">Pat is pet, and pit is pat;</p>
<p class="t0">Hid is hide, and hod is hid;</p>
<p class="t0">Did is deed, and done is did!</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now, there is one thing more,&rdquo; continued Zixi;
&ldquo;and this is very important. You must each wear
the handsomest and most splendid cloak you can
secure when you come to me to-morrow morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This request made Princess Fluff thoughtful all the
way home, for she at once remembered her magic
cloak, and wondered if the strange Miss Trust knew
she possessed it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<p>She asked Bud about it that night, and the young
king said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid this witch-woman is some one trying
to get hold of your magic cloak. I would advise you
not to wear it when she is around, or, more than
likely, she may steal it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="pic45">
<img src="images/i_155_0675.jpg" alt="" width="734" height="592" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;&lsquo;NOW, THERE IS ONE THING MORE,&rsquo; CONTINUED ZIXI, &lsquo;AND THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<p>So Fluff did not wear her magic cloak the next
day, but selected in its place a pretty blue cape edged
with gold. When she and her maids reached the
cottage, Zixi cried out angrily:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is not your handsomest cloak. Go home
at once and get the other one!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Fluff, shortly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must! You must!&rdquo; insisted the witch-woman.
&ldquo;I can teach you nothing unless you wear
the other cloak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you know I had another cloak?&rdquo; asked
the princess, suspiciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By witchcraft, perhaps,&rdquo; said Zixi, mildly. &ldquo;If
you want to be a witch you must wear it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be a witch,&rdquo; declared Fluff.
&ldquo;Come, girls, come; let&rsquo;s go home at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait&mdash;wait!&rdquo; implored Zixi, eagerly. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll
get the cloak I will teach you the most wonderful
things in the world! I will make you the most powerful
witch that ever lived!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you,&rdquo; replied Fluff; and then she
marched back to the palace with all her maids.</p>
<p>But Zixi knew her plot had failed; so she locked
up the cottage and went back again to Ix, climbing
the mountain and crossing the river and threading
the forest with angry thoughts and harsh words.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<div class="img" id="pic46">
<img src="images/i_157_0676.jpg" alt="" width="724" height="571" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;&lsquo;THAT IS NOT YOUR HANDSOMEST CLOAK. GO HOME AT ONCE AND GET THE OTHER ONE!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Yet the queen was more determined than ever to
secure the magic cloak. As soon as she had re&euml;ntered
her palace and by more incantations had again
transformed her hair to yellow and her eyes to black
and dressed herself in her royal robes, she summoned
her generals and counselors and told them to make
ready to war upon the kingdom of Noland.</p>

<h2 id="c13"><span class="h2line1"><span class="sc">Chapter XIII.</span></span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">TULLYDUB RESCUES THE KINGDOM.</span></h2>
<p>All soldiers love to fight; so when the army of
Ix learned that they were to go to war, they rejoiced
exceedingly over the news.</p>
<p>They polished up their swords and battle-axes, and
sewed all the missing buttons on their uniforms, and
mended their socks, and had their hair cut, and were
ready to march as soon as the queen was ready to
have them start.</p>
<p>King Bud of Noland had an army of seven thousand
seven hundred and seventy-seven men, besides
a general ten feet high; but the Queen of Ix had an
army more than twice as big, and she decided to lead
it in person, so that when she had conquered the city
of Nole she herself could seize the precious magic
cloak which she so greatly coveted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>

<p class="caption">&ldquo;QUEEN ZIXI RODE OUT AT THE HEAD OF HER ARMY, CLAD
IN A SUIT OF MAIL.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<p>Therefore Queen Zixi rode out at the head of her
army, clad in a suit of mail, with a glittering helmet
upon her head that was surmounted by a flowing
white plume. And all the soldiers cheered their
queen and had no doubt at all that she would win a
glorious victory.</p>
<p>Quavo the minstrel, who wandered constantly
about, was on his way to Noland again; and while
Queen Zixi&rsquo;s army was cutting a path through the
forest and making a bridge to cross the river, he came
speedily by a little-known path to the city of Nole,
where he told Tullydub, the lord high counselor, what
was threatening his king.</p>
<p>So, trembling with terror, Tullydub hastened to
the palace and called a meeting of the five high counselors
in the king&rsquo;s antechamber.</p>
<p>When all were assembled, together with Bud and
Fluff, the old man told his news and cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall all be slaughtered and our kingdom
sacked and destroyed, for the army of Ix is twice as
big as our own&mdash;yes, twice as big!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, pooh! What of that?&rdquo; said Tollydob, scornfully;
&ldquo;have they a general as tall as I am?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; said the chief counselor. &ldquo;Who
ever saw a man as tall as you are?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll fight and conquer them!&rdquo; declared
Tollydob, rising and walking about the room, so that
all might see where his head just grazed the ceiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you can&rsquo;t, general; you can&rsquo;t fight an army
by yourself!&rdquo; remonstrated Tullydub, excitedly. &ldquo;And
being so big, you are a better mark for their arrows
and axes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this the general sat down rather suddenly and
grew pale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we can buy them off,&rdquo; remarked the lord
high purse-bearer, jingling the purse that now never
became empty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m afraid not,&rdquo; sighed Tullydub. &ldquo;Quavo
the minstrel said they were bent upon conquest, and
were resolved upon a battle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And their queen is a witch,&rdquo; added Tallydab,
nervously. &ldquo;We must not forget that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A witch!&rdquo; exclaimed Princess Fluff, with sudden
interest. &ldquo;What does she look like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But all shook their heads at the question, and Tullydub
explained:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<p>&ldquo;None of us has ever seen her, for we have never
been friendly with the people of Ix. But from all
reports, Queen Zixi is both young and beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="pic48">
<img src="images/i_163_0039.jpg" alt="" width="442" height="632" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;THE GENERAL SAT DOWN SUDDENLY AND GREW PALE.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s the one who wanted to teach me
witchcraft in order to steal my magic cloak!&rdquo; said
Fluff, with sudden excitement. &ldquo;And when she
found she couldn&rsquo;t steal it, she went back after her
army.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<p>&ldquo;What magic cloak do you refer to?&rdquo; asked Tullydub.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the one the fairies gave me,&rdquo; replied Fluff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it of gorgeous colors with golden threads running
through it?&rdquo; asked the lord high general, now
thoroughly interested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the princess, &ldquo;the very same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what peculiar powers does it possess?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it grants its wearer the fulfillment of one
wish,&rdquo; she answered.</p>
<p>All the high counselors regarded her earnestly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then that was the cloak I wore when I wished
to be ten feet high!&rdquo; said Tollydob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I wore it when I wished I could reach the
apple,&rdquo; said Tellydeb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I wore it when I wished that my dog Ruffles
could speak,&rdquo; said Tallydab.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I wore it when I wished the royal purse
would always remain full,&rdquo; said Tillydib.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">165</div>
<p>&ldquo;I did not know that,&rdquo; remarked Fluff, thoughtfully.
&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll never forget that I lent it to Aunt
Rivette, and that was the time she wished she could
fly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s wonderful!&rdquo; cried old Tullydub. &ldquo;Has
it granted you, also, a wish?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Fluff, brightly. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ve been
happy ever since.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And has your brother, the king, had a wish?&rdquo;
Tullydub inquired eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Bud. &ldquo;I can still have mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why doesn&rsquo;t your Majesty wear the cloak
and wish that your army shall conquer the Queen of
Ix&rsquo;s?&rdquo; asked the lord high counselor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m saving my wish,&rdquo; answered Bud, &ldquo;and it
won&rsquo;t be that, either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But unless something is done we shall all be
destroyed,&rdquo; protested Tullydub.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then wear the cloak yourself,&rdquo; said Bud. &ldquo;You
haven&rsquo;t had a wish yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; cried the four other counselors; and the
lord high general added: &ldquo;That will surely save us
from any further worry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fetch the cloak at once,&rdquo; said Fluff, and she
ran quickly from the room to get it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<p>&ldquo;Supposing,&rdquo; Tullydub remarked hesitatingly, &ldquo;the
magic power shouldn&rsquo;t work?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but it will!&rdquo; answered the general.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it will,&rdquo; said the steward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it will,&rdquo; declared
the purse-bearer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It cannot fail,&rdquo; affirmed
the executioner; &ldquo;remember
what it has already
done for us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Fluff arrived
with the cloak; and,
after considering carefully
how he would speak
his wish, the lord high
counselor drew the cloak
over his shoulders
and said
solemnly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish that
we shall be
able to defeat our enemies, and drive them all
from the kingdom of Noland.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="pic49">
<img src="images/i_166_0040.jpg" alt="" width="516" height="623" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;THE LORD HIGH COUNSELOR DREW THE CLOAK OVER HIS SHOULDERS.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">167</div>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you make two wishes instead of one?&rdquo;
asked the princess, anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; said the general; &ldquo;if we defeat
them it will be easy enough to drive them from our
kingdom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lord high counselor removed the cloak and
carefully refolded it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it grants my wish,&rdquo; said he, thoughtfully, &ldquo;it
will indeed be lucky for our country that the Princess
Fluff came to live in the palace of the king.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">The queen formed her men into a line of battle
facing the army of Nole, and they were so numerous
in comparison with their enemies that even the more
timorous soldiers gained confidence, and stood up
straight and threw out their chests as if to show how
brave they were.</p>
<p>Then Queen Zixi, clad in her flashing mail and
mounted upon her magnificent white charger, rode
slowly along the ranks, her white plume nodding
gracefully with the motion of the horse.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<p>And when she reached the center of the line she
halted, and addressed her army in a voice that sounded
clear as the tones of a bell and reached to every listening
ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Soldiers of the land of Ix,&rdquo; she began, &ldquo;we are
about to engage in a great battle for conquest and
glory. Before you lies the rich city of Nole, and
when you have defeated yonder army and gained the
gates you may divide among yourselves all the plunder
of gold and silver and jewels and precious stones
that the place contains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hearing this, a great shout of joy arose from the
soldiers, which Zixi quickly silenced with a wave of
her white hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For myself,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;I desire nothing
more than a cloak that is owned by the Princess
Fluff. All else shall be given to my brave army.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;supposed we do not win the battle?&rdquo; asked
one of her generals, anxiously. &ldquo;What then do we
gain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing but disgrace,&rdquo; answered the queen,
haughtily. &ldquo;But how can we fail to win when I
myself lead the assault? Queen Zixi of Ix has fought
a hundred battles and never yet met with defeat!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<p>There was more cheering at this, for Zixi&rsquo;s words
were quite true. Nevertheless, her soldiers did not
like the look of that silent army of Nole standing so
steadfastly before the gates and facing the invaders
with calm determination.</p>
<p>Zixi herself was somewhat disturbed at this sight,
for she could not guess what powers the magic cloak
had given to the Nolanders. But in a loud and undaunted
voice she shouted the command to advance;
and while trumpets blared and drums rolled, the great
army of Ix awoke to action and marched steadily
upon the men of Nole.</p>
<p>Bud, who could not bear to remain shut up in his
palace while all this excitement was occurring outside
the city gates, had slipped away from Fluff and joined
his gigantic general, Tollydob. He was, of course,
unused to war, and when he beheld the vast array
of Zixi&rsquo;s army he grew fearful that the magic cloak
might not be able to save his city from conquest.</p>
<p>Yet the five high counselors, who were all present,
seemed not to worry the least bit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re very pretty soldiers to look at,&rdquo; remarked
old Tollydob, complacently. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m really sorry to
defeat them, they march so beautifully.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<p>&ldquo;But do not let your kind-hearted admiration for
the enemy interfere with our plans,&rdquo; said the lord
high executioner, who was standing by with his hands
in his pockets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I won&rsquo;t!&rdquo; answered the big general, with a
laugh which was succeeded by a frown. &ldquo;Yet I can
never resist admiring a fine soldier, whether he fights
for or against me. For instance, just look at that
handsome officer riding beside Queen Zixi&mdash;her
chief general, I think. Isn&rsquo;t he sweet? He looks
just like an apple, he is so round and wears such a
tight-fitting red jacket. Can&rsquo;t you pick him for me,
friend Tellydeb?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="pic50">
<img src="images/i_171_0043.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="436" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;THE LORD HIGH EXECUTIONER SUDDENLY STRETCHED OUT HIS LONG ARM, AND
REACHED THE FAR-AWAY GENERAL OF IX, AND PULLED HIM FROM HIS HORSE.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try.&rdquo; And the lord high executioner suddenly
stretched out his long arm, and reached the
far-away general of Ix, and pulled him from the back
of his horse.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<p>Then, amid the terrified cries that came from the
opposing army, Tellydeb dragged his victim swiftly
over the ground until he was seized by the men of
Nole and firmly bound with cords.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, my friend,&rdquo; said the general, again
laughing and then frowning. &ldquo;Now get for me that
pretty queen, if you please.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<p>Once more the long arm of the lord high executioner
shot out toward the army of Ix. But Zixi&rsquo;s
keen eyes saw it coming, and instantly she disappeared,
her magical arts giving her power to become
invisible.</p>
<p>Tellydeb, puzzled to find the queen gone, seized
another officer instead of her and dragged him quickly
over the intervening space to his own side, where he
was bound by the Nolanders and placed beside his
fellow-captive.</p>
<p>Another cry of horror came from the army of Ix,
and with one accord the soldiers stopped short in
their advance. Queen Zixi, appearing again in their
midst, called upon her wavering soldiers to charge
quickly upon the foe.</p>
<p>But the men, bewildered and terrified, were deaf
to her appeals. They fled swiftly back, over the brow
of the hill, and concealed themselves in the wooded
valley until the sun set. And it was far into the
night before Queen Zixi succeeded in restoring her
line of battle.</p>

<h2 id="c14"><span class="h2line1"><span class="sc">Chapter XIV.</span></span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE ROUT OF THE ARMY OF IX.</span></h2>
<p>The next day was a busy one in the city of Nole.
The ten-foot lord high general marched his seven
thousand seven hundred and seventy-seven men out
of the city gates and formed them in line of battle on
the brow of a hill. Then he asked Aunt Rivette to
fly over the top of the mountain and see where the
enemy was located.</p>
<p>The old woman gladly undertook the mission. She
had by this time become an expert flier, and, being
proud to resemble a bird, she dressed herself in flowing
robes of as many colors as a poll-parrot could
boast. When she mounted into the air, streamers of
green and yellow silk floated behind her in quite a
beautiful and interesting fashion, and she was admired
by all beholders.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">174</div>
<p>Aunt Rivette flew high above the mountain-top,
and there she saw the great army of Queen Zixi
climbing up the slope on the other side. The army
also saw her, and stopped short in amazement at seeing
a woman fly like a bird. They had before this
thought their queen sure of victory, because she was
a witch and possessed many wonderful arts; but now
they saw that the people of Noland could also do
wonderful things, and it speedily disheartened them.</p>
<p>Zixi ordered them to shoot a thousand arrows at
Aunt Rivette, but quickly countermanded the order,
as the old woman was too high to be injured, and the
arrows would have been wasted.</p>
<p>When the army of Ix had climbed the mountain
and was marching down again toward Nole, the lord
high steward sent his dog Ruffles to them to make
more mischief. Ruffles trotted soberly among the
soldiers of Ix, and once in a while he would pause
and say in a loud voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The army of Noland will conquer you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then all the soldiers would look around to see who
had spoken these fearful words, but could see nothing
but a little dog; and Ruffles would pretend to be
scratching his nose with his left hind foot, and would
look so innocent that they never for a moment suspected
he could speak.</p>

<p class="caption">&ldquo;AND RUFFLES WOULD PRETEND TO BE SCRATCHING HIS NOSE WITH HIS LEFT HIND FOOT.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;We are surrounded by invisible foes!&rdquo; cried the
soldiers; and they would have fled even then had not
Queen Zixi called them cowards and stubbornly declared
that they only fancied they had heard the
voices speak. Some of them believed her, and some
did not; but they decided to remain and fight, since
they had come so far to do so.</p>
<p>Then they formed in line of battle again and marched
boldly toward the army of Noland.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">176</div>
<p>While they were still a good way off, and the generals
were riding in front of their soldiers, the lord
high executioner suddenly stretched out his long arm
and pulled another general of Ix from his horse, as
he had done the day before, dragging him swiftly
over the ground between the opposing armies until
he was seized by the men of Nole and tightly bound
with cords.</p>
<p>The soldiers of Ix uttered murmurs of horror at
this sight, and stopped again.</p>
<p>Immediately the long arm shot out, and pulled
another general from their ranks, and made him
prisoner.</p>
<p>Queen Zixi raved and stormed with anger; but
the lord high executioner, who was enjoying himself
immensely, continued to grab officer after officer and
make them prisoners: and so far there had been no
sign of battle; not an arrow had been fired nor an
ax swung.</p>
<p>Then, to complete the amazement of the enemy,
the gigantic ten-foot general of the army of Nole
stepped in front of his men and waved around his
head a flashing sword six feet in length, while he
shouted in a voice like a roar of thunder, that made
the army of Ix tremble:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">177</div>
<p>&ldquo;Forward, soldiers of Noland&mdash;forward! Destroy
the enemy, and let none escape!&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<p>It was more than the army of Ix could bear. Filled
with terror, the soldiers threw down their arms and
fled in a great panic, racing over the mountain-top
and down the other side and then scattering in every
direction, each man for himself and as if he feared
the entire army of Noland was at his heels.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">179</div>
<p>But it wasn&rsquo;t. Not a soldier of Nole had moved
in pursuit. Every one was delighted at the easy victory,
and King Bud was so amused at the sight of
the flying foe that he rolled on the ground in laughter,
and even the fierce-looking General Tollydob grinned
in sympathy.</p>

<br /><span class="h2line2">THE THEFT OF THE MAGIC CLOAK.</span></h2>
<p>When the soldiers of Queen Zixi ran away, they
fled in so many different directions that the bewildered
queen could not keep track of them. Her
horse, taking fright, dashed up the mountain-side and
tossed Zixi into a lilac-bush, after which he ran off
and left her.</p>
<p>One would think such a chain of misfortunes could
not fail to daunt the bravest. But Zixi had lived too
many years to allow such trifles as defeat and flight
to ruin her nerves; so she calmly disentangled herself
from the lilac-bush and looked around to see where
she was.</p>
<p>It was very quiet and peaceful on this part of the
mountain-side. Her glittering army had disappeared
to the last man.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">182</div>
<p>In the far distance she could see the spires and
turreted palaces of the city of Nole, and behind her
was a thick grove of lilac-trees bearing flowers in full
bloom.</p>
<p>This lilac-grove gave Zixi an idea. She pushed
aside some of the branches and entered the cool,
shadowy avenues between the trees.</p>
<p>The air was heavy with the scent of the violet
flowers, and tiny humming-birds were darting here
and there to thrust their long bills into the blossoms
and draw out the honey for food. Butterflies there
were, too, and a few chipmunks perched high among
the branches. But Zixi walked on through the trees
in deep thought, and presently she had laid new plans.</p>
<p>For since the magic cloak was so hard to get she
wanted it more than ever.</p>
<p>By and by she gathered some bits of the lilac-bark,
and dug some roots from the ground. Next she
caught six spotted butterflies, from the wings of which
she brushed off all the round, purple spots. Then
she wandered on until she came upon a little spring
of water bubbling from the ground, and filling a cup-shaped
leaf of the tatti-plant from the spring, she
mixed her bark and roots and butterfly spots in the
liquid and boiled it carefully over a fire of twigs; for
tatti-leaves will not burn so long as there is water
inside them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">183</div>
<p>When her magical compound was ready, Zixi muttered
an incantation and drank it in a single draught.</p>
<p>A few moments later the witch-queen had disappeared,
and in her place stood the likeness of a pretty
young girl dressed in a simple white gown with pink
ribbons at the shoulders and a pink sash around her
waist. Her light-brown hair was gathered into two
long braids that hung down her back, and she had
two big blue eyes that looked very innocent and sweet.
Besides these changes, both the nose and the mouth
of the girl differed in shape from those of Zixi; so
that no one would have seen the slightest resemblance
between the two people, or between Miss Trust and
the girl who stood in the lilac-grove.</p>
<p>The transformed witch-queen gave a sweet, rippling
laugh, and glanced at her reflection in the still waters
of the spring. And then the girlish face frowned,
for the image glaring up at her was that of a wrinkled,
toothless old hag.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">184</div>
<p>&ldquo;I really must have that cloak,&rdquo; sighed the girl;
and then she turned and walked out of the lilac-grove
and down the mountain-side toward the city of Nole.</p>
<p>The Princess Fluff was playing tennis with her
maids in a courtyard of the royal palace, when Jikki
came to say that a girl wished to speak with her
Highness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Send her here,&rdquo; said Fluff.</p>
<p>So the witch-queen came to her, in the guise of the
fair young girl; and bowing in a humble manner
before the princess, she said: &ldquo;Please, your Highness,
may I be one of your maids?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I have eight already!&rdquo; answered Fluff,
laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But my father and mother are both dead; and I
have come all the way from my castle to beg you to let
me wait upon you,&rdquo; said the girl, looking at the little
princess with a pleading expression in her blue eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; asked Fluff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am daughter of the Lord Hurrydole, and my
name is Adlena,&rdquo; replied the girl, which was not altogether
a falsehood, because one of her ancestors had
borne the name Hurrydole, and Adlena was one of
her own names.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">185</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then, Adlena,&rdquo; said Fluff, brightly, &ldquo;you shall
certainly be one of my maids; for there is plenty of
room in the palace, and the more girls I have around
me the happier I shall be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Queen Zixi, under the name of Adlena, became
an inmate of the king&rsquo;s palace; and it was not many
days before she learned where the magic cloak was
kept. For the princess gave her a key to a drawer
and told her to get from it a blue silk scarf she wished
to wear, and directly under the scarf lay the fairy
garment.</p>
<p>Adlena would have seized it at that moment had
she dared; but Fluff was in the same room, so she
only said: &ldquo;Please, princess, may I look at that pretty
cloak?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; answered Fluff; &ldquo;but handle it carefully,
for it was given me by the fairies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Adlena unfolded the cloak and looked at it very
carefully, noting exactly the manner in which it was
woven. Then she folded it again, arranged it in the
drawer, and turned the key, which the princess immediately
attached to a chain which she always wore
around her neck.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">186</div>
<p>That night, when the witch-queen was safely locked
in her own room and could not be disturbed, she
called about her a great many of those invisible imps
that serve the most skilful witches, commanding them
to weave for her a cloak in the exact likeness of the
one given Princess Fluff by the fairies.</p>
<p>Of course the imps had never seen the magic cloak;
but Zixi described it to them accurately, and before
morning they had woven a garment so closely resembling
the original that the imitation was likely to deceive
any one.</p>
<p>Only one thing was missing, and that was the
golden thread woven by Queen Lulea herself, and
which gave the cloak its magic powers.</p>
<p>Of course the imps of Zixi could not get this golden
thread, nor could they give any magical properties to
the garment they had made at the witch&rsquo;s command;
but they managed to give the cloak all of the many
brilliant colors of the original, and Zixi was quite
satisfied.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">187</div>
<p>The next day Adlena wore this cloak while she
walked in the garden. Very soon Princess Fluff saw
her and ran after the girl, crying indignantly: &ldquo;See
here! What do you mean by wearing my cloak?
Take it off instantly!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="pic55">
<img src="images/i_187_0159.jpg" alt="" width="482" height="623" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;&lsquo;WHICH IS MINE?&rsquo; SHE FINALLY ASKED, IN A STARTLED VOICE.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t your cloak. It is one of my own,&rdquo; replied
the girl, calmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense! There can&rsquo;t be two such cloaks in
the world,&rdquo; retorted Fluff.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">188</div>
<p>&ldquo;But there are,&rdquo; persisted Adlena. &ldquo;How could
I get the one in your drawer when the key is around
your own neck?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; admitted the princess,
beginning to be puzzled. &ldquo;But come with me into
my rooms. If my fairy cloak is indeed in the drawer,
then I will believe you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they went to the drawer, and of course found
the magic cloak, as the cunning Zixi had planned.
Fluff pulled it out and held the two up together to
compare them; and they seemed to be exactly alike.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think yours is a little the longer,&rdquo; said Adlena,
and threw it over the shoulders of the princess. &ldquo;No,
I think mine is the longer,&rdquo; she continued; and removing
the magic cloak, put her own upon Fluff.
They seemed to be about the same length, but Adlena
kept putting first one and then the other upon the
princess, until they were completely mixed, and the
child could not have told one from the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which is mine?&rdquo; she finally asked, in a startled
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This, of course,&rdquo; answered Adlena, folding up the
imitation cloak which the imps had made, and putting
it away in the drawer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">189</div>
<p>Fluff never suspected the trick, so Zixi carried away
the magic cloak she had thus cleverly stolen; and
she was so delighted with the success of her stratagem
that she could have screamed aloud for pure joy.</p>
<p>As soon as she was alone and unobserved, the
witch-queen slipped out of the palace, and, carrying
the magic cloak in a bundle under her arm, ran down
the streets of Nole and out through the gate in the
wall and away toward the mountain where the lilac-grove
lay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At last!&rdquo; she kept saying to herself. &ldquo;At last
I shall see my own beautiful reflection in a mirror,
instead of that horrid old hag!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When she was safe in the grove she succeeded,
by means of her witchcraft, in transforming the girl
Adlena back into the beautiful woman known throughout
the kingdom of Ix as Queen Zixi. And then
she lost no time in throwing the magic cloak over
her shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish,&rdquo; she cried in a loud voice, &ldquo;that my reflection
in every mirror will hereafter show the same face
and form as that in which I appear to exist in the
sight of all mortals!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">190</div>
<p>Then she threw off the cloak and ran to the crystal
spring, saying: &ldquo;Now, indeed, I shall at last see the
lovely Queen Zixi!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But as she bent over the spring, she gave a sudden
shriek of disappointed rage; for glaring up at her
from the glassy surface of the water was the same
fearful hag she had always seen as the reflection of
her likeness!</p>
<p>The magic cloak would grant no wish to a person
who had stolen it.</p>
<p>Zixi, more wretched than she had ever been before
in her life, threw herself down upon her face in the
lilac-grove and wept for more than an hour, which is
an exceedingly long time for tears to run from one&rsquo;s
eyes. And when she finally arose, two tiny brooks
flowed from the spot and wound through the lilac-trees&mdash;one
to the right and one to the left.</p>
<p>Then, leaving the magic cloak&mdash;to possess which
she had struggled so hard and sinfully&mdash;lying unheeded
upon the ground, the disappointed witch-queen
walked slowly away, and finally reached the
bank of the great river.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">191</div>
<div class="img" id="pic56">
<img src="images/i_191_0162.jpg" alt="" width="729" height="1002" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;SHE THREW OFF THE CLOAK AND RAN TO THE CRYSTAL SPRING.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">193</div>
<p>Here she found a rugged old alligator who lay
upon the bank, weeping with such bitterness that the
sight reminded Zixi of her own recent outburst of
sorrow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you weep, friend?&rdquo; she asked, for her
experience as a witch had long since taught her the
language of the beasts and birds and reptiles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I cannot climb a tree,&rdquo; answered the
alligator.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why do you wish to climb a tree?&rdquo; she questioned,
surprised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; returned the alligator, squeezing
two more tears from his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that is very foolish!&rdquo; exclaimed the witch-queen,
scornfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said the alligator. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t
strike me that it&rsquo;s much more foolish than the fancies
some other people have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not,&rdquo; replied Zixi, more gently, and
walked away in deep thought.</p>
<p>While she followed the river-bank, to find a ferry
across, the dusk fell, and presently a gray owl came
out of a hollow in a tall tree and sat upon a limb,
wailing dismally.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">194</div>
<p>Zixi stopped and looked at the bird.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you wail so loudly?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic57">
<img src="images/i_194_0160.jpg" alt="" width="551" height="704" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;&lsquo;BECAUSE I CANNOT CLIMB A TREE,&rsquo; ANSWERED THE ALLIGATOR.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Because I cannot swim in the river like a fish,&rdquo;
answered the owl, and it screeched so sadly that it
made the queen shiver.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">195</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you wish to swim?&rdquo; she inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said the owl, and buried its head
under its wing with a groan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that is absurd!&rdquo; cried Zixi, with impatience.</p>
<p>The owl had an ear out, and heard her. So it
withdrew its head long enough to retort:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s any more absurd than the longings
of some other folks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you are right,&rdquo; said the queen, and hung
her head as she walked on.</p>
<p>By and by she found a ferryman with a boat, and
he agreed to row her across the river. In one end
of the boat crouched a little girl, the ferryman&rsquo;s daughter,
and she sobbed continually, so that the sound of
the child&rsquo;s grief finally attracted Zixi&rsquo;s attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you sob?&rdquo; questioned the queen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I want to be a man,&rdquo; replied the child,
trying to stifle her sobs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you want to be a man?&rdquo; asked Zixi,
curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I&rsquo;m a little girl,&rdquo; was the reply.</p>
<p>This made Zixi angry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a little fool!&rdquo; she exclaimed loudly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">196</div>
<p>&ldquo;There are other fools in the world,&rdquo; said the child,
and renewed her sobs.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic58">
<img src="images/i_196_0165.jpg" alt="" width="744" height="567" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;&lsquo;WHY DO YOU SOB?&rsquo; QUESTIONED THE QUEEN.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Zixi did not reply, but she thought to herself:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are all alike&mdash;the alligator, the owl, the girl,
and the powerful Queen of Ix. We long for what
we cannot have, yet desire it not so much because it
would benefit us, as because it is beyond our reach.
If I call the others fools, I must also call myself a
fool for wishing to see the reflection of a beautiful
girl in my mirror when I know it is impossible. So
hereafter I shall strive to be contented with my lot.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">197</div>
<p>This was a wise resolution, and the witch-queen
abided by it for many years. She was not very bad,
this Zixi; for it must be admitted that few have the
courage to acknowledge their faults and strive to correct
them, as she did.</p>

<h2 id="c16"><span class="h2line1"><span class="sc">Chapter XVI.</span></span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE PLAIN ABOVE THE CLOUDS.</span></h2>
<p>I have already mentioned how high the mountains
were between Noland and the land of Ix; but at the
north of the city of Nole were mountains much higher&mdash;so
high, indeed, that they seemed to pierce the
clouds, and it was said the moon often stopped on
the highest peak to rest. It was not one single slope
up from the lowlands; but first there was a high
mountain, with a level plain at the top; and then
another high mountain, rising from the level and
capped with a second plain; and then another mountain,
and so on; which made them somewhat resemble
a pair of stairs. So that the people of Nole, who
looked upon the North Mountains with much pride,
used to point them out as &ldquo;The Giant&rsquo;s Stairway,&rdquo;
forgetting that no giant was ever big enough to use
such an immense flight of stairs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">199</div>
<p>Many people had climbed the first mountain, and
upon the plain at its top flocks of sheep were fed;
and two or three people boasted they had climbed
the second steep; but beyond that the mountains
were all unknown to the dwellers in the valley of
Noland. As a matter of fact, no one lived upon
them; they were inhabited only by a few small animals
and an occasional vulture or eagle which nested
in some rugged crag.</p>
<p>But at the top of all was an enormous plain that
lay far above the clouds, and here the Roly-Rogues
dwelt in great numbers.</p>
<p>I must describe these Roly-Rogues to you, for they
were unlike any other people in all the world. Their
bodies were as round as a ball&mdash;if you can imagine
a ball fully four feet in thickness at the middle. And
their muscles were as tough and elastic as india-rubber.
They had heads and arms resembling our own,
and very short legs; and all these they could withdraw
into their ball-like bodies whenever they wished,
very much as a turtle withdraws its legs and head
into its shell.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">200</div>
<p>The Roly-Rogues lived all by themselves in their
country among the clouds, and there were thousands
and thousands of them. They were quarrelsome by
nature, but could seldom hurt one another; because,
if they fought, they would withdraw their arms and
legs and heads into their bodies, and roll themselves
at one another with much fierceness. But when they
collided they would bounce apart again, and little
harm was done.</p>
<p>In spite of their savage dispositions the Roly-Rogues
had as yet done no harm to any one but
themselves, as they lived so high above the world
that other people knew nothing of their existence.
Nor did they themselves know, because of the clouds
that floated between, of the valleys which lay below
them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">201</div>
<p>But, as ill luck would have it, a few days after King
Bud&rsquo;s army had defeated the army of Ix, one of the
Roly-Rogues, while fighting with another, rolled too
near the edge of the plain whereon they dwelt, and
bounded down the mountain-side that faced Noland.
Wind had scattered the clouds, so his fellows immediately
rolled themselves to the edge and watched the
luckless Roly-Rogue fly down the mountain, bounce
across the plain, and thence speed down the next
mountain. By and by he became a dot to their eyes,
and then a mere speck; but as the clouds had just
rolled away for a few moments the Roly-Rogues
could see, by straining their eyes, the city of Nole
lying in the valley far below.</p>
<p>It seemed, from that distance, merely a toy city,
but they knew it must be a big place to show so far
away; and since they had no cities of their own, they
became curious to visit the one they had just discovered.</p>
<p>The ruler of the Roly-Rogues, who was more quarrelsome
than any of the rest, had a talk with his chief
men about visiting the unknown city.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can roll down the mountain just as our brother
did,&rdquo; he argued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how in the world could we ever get back
again?&rdquo; said one of the chiefs, sticking his head up
to look with astonishment at the ruler.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to get back,&rdquo; said the other, excitedly.
&ldquo;Some one has built many houses and palaces
at the foot of the mountains, and we can live in those, if
they are big enough and if there are enough of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps the people won&rsquo;t let us,&rdquo; suggested another
chief, who was not in favor of the expedition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will fight them and destroy them,&rdquo; retorted
the ruler, scowling at the chief as if he would make
him ashamed of his cowardice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we must all go together,&rdquo; said a third chief;
&ldquo;for, if only a few go, we may find ourselves many
times outnumbered and at last be overcome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every Roly-Rogue in the country shall go!&rdquo;
declared the ruler, who brooked no opposition when
once he had made up his mind to a thing.</p>
<p>On the plain grew a grove of big thorn-trees, bearing
thorns as long and sharp as swords; so the ruler
commanded each of his people to cut two of the
thorns, one for each hand, with which to attack whatever
foes they might meet when they reached the
unknown valley.</p>
<p>Then, on a certain day, all the hundreds and thousands
of Roly-Rogues that were in existence assembled

<p>All the gold that was needed the royal purse-bearer
was able to supply from his overflowing purse. The
gigantic General Tollydob became famous throughout
the world, and no nation dared attack the army of
Noland. The talking dog of old Tallydab made
every one wonder, and people came many miles to
see Ruffles and hear him speak. It was said that all
this good fortune had been brought to Noland by the
pretty Princess Fluff, who was a favorite of the fairies;
and the people loved her on this account as well as
for her bright and sunny disposition.</p>

<p class="caption">&ldquo;THE GREAT BALL STRUCK THE FIELD NEAR THEM.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>King Bud caused his subjects some little anxiety,
to be sure; for they never could tell what he was
liable to do next, except that he was sure to do something
unexpected. But much is forgiven a king; and
if Bud made some pompous old nobleman stand on
his head, to amuse a mob of people, he would give
him a good dinner afterward and fill his purse with
gold to make up for the indignity. Fluff often reproved
her brother for such pranks, but Bud&rsquo;s soul
was flooded with mischief, and it was hard for him
to resist letting a little of the surplus escape now and
then.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">207</div>
<p>After all, the people were fairly content and prosperous,
and no one was at all prepared for the disasters
soon to overtake them.</p>
<p>One day, while King Bud was playing at ball with
some of his courtiers on a field outside the city gates,
the first warning of trouble reached him. Bud had
batted a ball high into the air, and while looking upward
for it to descend he saw another ball bound
from the plain at the top of the North Mountains,
fly into the air, and then sink gradually toward him.
As it approached, it grew bigger and bigger, until it
assumed mammoth proportions; and then, while the
courtiers screamed in terror, the great ball struck the
field near them, bounced high into the air, and came
down directly upon the sharp point of one of the palace
towers, where it stuck fast with a yell that sounded
almost human.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">208</div>
<p>For some moments Bud and his companions were
motionless through surprise and fear; then they rushed
into the city and stood among the crowd of people
which had congregated at the foot of the tower to
stare at the big ball impaled upon its point. Once in
a while, two arms, two short legs, and a head would
dart out from the ball and wiggle frantically, and then
the yell would be repeated and the head and limbs
withdrawn swiftly into the ball.</p>
<p>It was all so curious that the people were justified
in staring at it in amazement; for certainly no one
had ever seen or heard of a Roly-Rogue before, or
even known such a creature existed.</p>
<p>Finally, as no one else could reach the steeple-top,
Aunt Rivette flew into the air and circled slowly
around the ball. When next its head was thrust out,
she called:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you a mud-turtle or a man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you which, if I get hold of you,&rdquo; answered
the Roly-Rogue, fiercely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you come from?&rdquo; asked Aunt Rivette,
taking care the wiggling arms did not grab her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">209</div>
<div class="img" id="pic61">

<p class="caption">&ldquo;&lsquo;WHERE DID YOU COME FROM?&rsquo; ASKED AUNT RIVETTE.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">211</div>
<p>&ldquo;That is none of your business,&rdquo; said the RolyRogue.
&ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t intend to come, that you may
depend upon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you hurt?&rdquo; she inquired, seeing that the
struggles of the creature made him spin around upon
the steeple-point like a windmill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not hurt at all,&rdquo; declared the Roly-Rogue;
&ldquo;but I&rsquo;d like to know how to get down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would you do if we helped you to get free?&rdquo;
asked Aunt Rivette.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d fight every one of those idiots who are laughing
at me down there!&rdquo; said the creature, its eyes
flashing wickedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;d best stay where you are,&rdquo; returned
old Rivette, who flew back to earth again to tell Bud
what the Roly-Rogue had said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe that is the best place for him,&rdquo; said Bud;
&ldquo;so we&rsquo;ll let him stay where he is. He&rsquo;s not very
ornamental, I must say, but he&rsquo;s very safe up there
on top of the steeple.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might have him gilded,&rdquo; proposed the old
woman, &ldquo;and then he&rsquo;d look better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll think it over,&rdquo; said the king, and he went
away to finish his ball game.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">212</div>
<p>The people talked and wondered about the queer
creature on the steeple, but no one could say where
it came from or what it was; they were naturally
much puzzled.</p>
<p>The next day was bright with sunshine; so, early
in the forenoon, Bud and Fluff had the royal cook
fill their baskets with good things to eat, and set out
to picnic on the bank of the river that separated Noland
from the kingdom of Ix. They rode ponies, to
reach the river sooner than by walking; and their
only companions were Tallydab, the lord high steward,
and his talking dog, Ruffles.</p>
<p>It was after this picnic party had passed over the
mountain, and were securely hidden from any one in
the city of Nole, that the ruler of the Roly-Rogues
and his thousands of followers hurled themselves
down from their land above the clouds and began
bounding toward the plain below.</p>
<p>The people first heard a roar that sounded like
distant thunder; and when they looked toward the
North Mountains they saw the air black with tiny
bouncing balls that seemed to drop from the drifting
clouds which always had obscured the highest peak.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">213</div>
<p>But, although appearing small when first seen,
these balls grew rapidly larger as they came nearer;
and then, with sharp reports like pistol-shots, they
began dropping upon the plain by dozens and hundreds
and then thousands.</p>
<p>As soon as they touched the ground they bounded
upward again, like rubber balls the children throw
upon the floor; but each bound was less violent than
the one preceding it, until finally within the streets of
the city and upon all the fields surrounding it lay the
thousands of Roly-Rogues that had fallen from the
mountain-peak.</p>
<p>At first they lay still, as if stunned by their swift
journey and collision with the hard earth; but after
a few seconds they recovered, thrust out their heads
and limbs, and scrambled upon their flat feet.</p>
<p>Then the savage Roly-Rogues uttered hoarse shouts
of joy, for they were safely arrived at the city they
had seen from afar, and the audacious adventure was
a success.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">214</div>
<h2 id="c18"><span class="h2line1"><span class="sc">CHAPTER XVIII.</span></span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE CONQUEST OF NOLAND.</span></h2>
<p>It would be impossible to describe the amazement
of the people of Nole when the Roly-Rogues came
upon them.</p>
<p>Not only was the descent wholly unexpected, but
the appearance of the invaders was queer enough to
strike terror to the stoutest heart.</p>
<p>Their round bodies were supported by short, strong
legs having broad, flattened feet to keep them steady.
Their arms were short, and the fingers of their hands,
while not long, were very powerful.</p>
<p>But the heads were the most startling portions of
these strange creatures. They were flat and thick
on the top, with leathery rolls around their necks; so
that, when the head was drawn in, its upper part
rounded out the surface of the ball. In this peculiar
head the Roly-Rogue had two big eyes as shiny as
porcelain, a small stubby nose, and a huge mouth.
Their strange leather-like clothing fitted their bodies
closely and was of different colors&mdash;green, yellow,
red, and brown.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">215</div>
<p>Taken altogether, the Roly-Rogues were not pretty
to look at; and although their big eyes gave them a
startled or astonished expression, nothing seemed ever
to startle or astonish them in the least.</p>
<p>When they arrived in the valley of Nole, after their
wonderful journey down the mountains, they scrambled
to their feet, extended their long arms with the
thorns clasped tight in their talon-like fingers, and
rushed in a furious crowd and with loud cries upon
the terror-stricken people.</p>
<p>The soldiers of Tollydob&rsquo;s brave army had not even
time to seize their weapons; for such a foe, coming
upon them through the air, had never been dreamed
of.</p>
<p>And the men of Nole, who might have resisted
the enemy, were too much frightened to do more than
tremble violently and gasp with open mouths. As
for the women and children, they fled screaming into
the houses and bolted or locked the doors, which was
doubtless the wisest thing they could have done.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">216</div>
<div class="img" id="pic62">
<img src="images/i_217_0287.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="527" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;AS FOR THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN,
THEY FLED SCREAMING INTO THE HOUSES.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">217</div>
<p>General Tollydob was asleep when the calamity of
this invasion occurred; but hearing the shouts, he ran
out of his mansion and met several of the Roly-Rogues
face to face. Without hesitation the brave general
rushed upon them; but two of the creatures promptly
rolled themselves against him from opposite directions,
so that the ten-foot giant was crushed between
them until there was not a particle of breath left in
his body. No sooner did these release him than two
other Roly-Rogues rolled toward him; but Tollydob
was not to be caught twice, so he gave a mighty jump
and jumped right over their heads, with the result
that the balls crashed against each other.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">218</div>
<p>This made the two Roly-Rogues so angry that
they began to fight each other savagely, and the general
started to run away. But other foes rolled after
him, knocked him down, and stuck their thorns into
him until he yelled for mercy and promised to become
their slave.</p>
<p>Tullydub, the chief counselor, watched all this from
his window, and it frightened him so greatly that he
crawled under his bed and hid, hoping the creatures
would not find him. But their big round eyes were
sharp at discovering things; so the Roly-Rogues had
not been in Tullydub&rsquo;s room two minutes before he
was dragged from beneath his bed, and prodded with
thorns until he promised obedience to the conquerors.</p>
<p>The lord high purse-bearer, at the first alarm, dug
a hole in the garden of the royal palace and buried
his purse so no one could find it but himself. But
he might have saved himself this trouble, for the Roly-Rogues
knew nothing of money or its uses, being
accustomed to seizing whatever they desired without
a thought of rendering payment for it.</p>
<p>Having buried his purse, old Tillydib gave himself
up to the invaders as their prisoner; and this saved
him the indignity of being conquered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">219</div>

<p class="caption">&ldquo;OTHER FOES ROLLED AFTER HIM AND KNOCKED HIM DOWN.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The lord high executioner may really be credited
with making the only serious fight of the day; for
when the Roly-Rogues came upon him, Tellydeb
seized his ax, and, before the enemy could come near,
he reached out his long arm and cleverly sliced the
heads off several of their round bodies.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">220</div>
<p>The others paused for a moment, being unused to
such warfare and not understanding how an arm
could reach so far.</p>
<p>But, seeing their heads were in danger, about a
hundred of the creatures formed themselves into balls
and rolled upon the executioner in a straight line,
hoping to crush him.</p>
<p>They could not see what happened after they began
to roll, their heads being withdrawn; but Tellydeb
watched them speed toward him, and, stepping aside,
he aimed a strong blow with his ax at the body of
the first Roly-Rogue that passed him. Instead of
cutting the rubber-like body, the ax bounced back
and flew from Tellydeb&rsquo;s hand into the air, falling
farther away than the long arm of the executioner
could reach. Therefore he was left helpless, and was
wise enough to surrender without further resistance.</p>
<p>Finding no one else to resist them, the Roly-Rogues
contented themselves with bounding against
the terrorized people, great and humble alike, and
knocking them over, laughing boisterously at the figures
sprawling in the mud of the streets.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">221</div>
<p>And then they would prick the bodies of the men
with their sharp thorns, making them spring to their
feet again with shrieks of fear, only to be bowled over
again the next minute.</p>
<p>But the monsters soon grew weary of this amusement,
for they were anxious to explore the city they
had so successfully invaded. They flocked into the
palace and public buildings, and gazed eagerly at the
many beautiful and, to them, novel things that were
found. The mirrors delighted them, and they fought
one another for the privilege of standing before the
glasses to admire the reflection of their horrid
bodies.</p>
<p>They could not sit in the chairs, for the round
bodies would not fit them; neither could the Roly-Rogues
understand the use of beds. For when they
rested or slept the creatures merely withdrew their
limbs and heads, rolled over upon their backs, and
slept soundly&mdash;no matter where they might be.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">222</div>
<p>The shops were all entered and robbed of their
wares, the Roly-Rogues wantonly destroying all that
they could not use. They were like ostriches in eating
anything that looked attractive to them; one of
the monsters swallowed several pretty glass beads,
and some of the more inquisitive of them invaded the
grocery-shops and satisfied their curiosity by tasting of
nearly everything in sight. It was funny to see their
wry faces when they sampled the salt and vinegar.</p>

<p class="caption">&ldquo;STEPPING ASIDE, TELLYDEB AIMED A STRONG BLOW WITH HIS AX AT THE
BODY OF THE FIRST ROLY-ROUGE.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">223</div>
<p>Presently the entire city was under the dominion
of the Roly-Rogues, who forced the unhappy people
to wait upon them and amuse them; and if any hesitated
to obey their commands, the monsters would
bump against them, pull their hair, and make them
suffer most miserably.</p>
<p>Aunt Rivette was in her room at the top of the
palace when the Roly-Rogues invaded the city of
Nole. At first she was as much frightened as the
others; but she soon remembered she could escape
the creatures by flying; so she quietly watched them
from the windows. By and by, as they explored the
palace, they came to Aunt Rivette&rsquo;s room and broke
in the door; but the old woman calmly stepped out
of her window upon a little iron balcony, spread her
great wings, and flew away before the Roly-Rogues
could catch her.</p>
<p>Then she soared calmly through the air, and having
remembered that Bud and Fluff had gone to the river
on a picnic, she flew swiftly in that direction and
before long came to where the children and old Tallydab
were eating their luncheon, while the dog Ruffles,
who was in good spirits, sang a comic song to
amuse them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">224</div>
<p>They were much surprised to see Aunt Rivette
flying toward them; but when she alighted and told
Bud that his kingdom had been conquered by the
Roly-Rogues and all his people enslaved, the little
party was so astonished that they stared at one another
in speechless amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Bud, what shall we do?&rdquo; finally asked Fluff,
in distress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Bud, struggling to swallow a
large piece of sandwich that in his excitement had
stuck fast in his throat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One thing is certain,&rdquo; remarked Aunt Rivette,
helping herself to a slice of cake, &ldquo;our happy lives
are now ruined forever. We should be foolish to
remain here; and the sooner we escape to some other
country where the Roly-Rogues cannot find us, the
safer we shall be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why run away?&rdquo; asked Bud. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t something
else be done? Here, Tallydab, you&rsquo;re one
of my counselors. What do you say about this affair?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now the lord high steward was a deliberate old
fellow, and before he replied he dusted the crumbs
from his lap, filled and lighted his long pipe, and
smoked several whiffs in a thoughtful manner.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">225</div>
<p>&ldquo;It strikes me,&rdquo; said he at last, &ldquo;that by means of
the Princess Fluff&rsquo;s magic cloak we can either destroy
or scatter these rascally invaders and restore the kingdom
to peace and prosperity.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="pic65">

<p class="caption">&ldquo;&lsquo;BUT WHERE&rsquo;S THE CLOAK?&rsquo; ASKED THE DOG.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure enough!&rdquo; replied Bud. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t we
think of that before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will have to make the wish, Bud,&rdquo; said Fluff,
&ldquo;for all the rest of us have wished, and you have not
made yours yet.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">226</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; answered the king. &ldquo;If I must, I
must. But I&rsquo;m sorry I have to do it now, for I was
saving my wish for something else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where&rsquo;s the cloak?&rdquo; asked the dog, rudely
breaking into the conversation. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t wish
without the cloak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cloak is locked up in a drawer in my room
at the palace,&rdquo; said Fluff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And our enemies have possession of the palace,&rdquo;
continued Tallydab, gloomily. &ldquo;Was there ever such
ill luck!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; said Aunt Rivette, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fly back
and get it&mdash;that is, if the Roly-Rogues haven&rsquo;t already
broken open the drawer and discovered the
cloak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please go at once, then!&rdquo; exclaimed Fluff. &ldquo;Here
is the key,&rdquo; and she unfastened it from the chain at
her neck and handed it to her aunt. &ldquo;But be careful,
whatever you do, that those horrible creatures do
not catch you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid,&rdquo; said Aunt Rivette, confidently.
And taking the key, the old lady at once flew away
in the direction of the city of Nole, promising to
return very soon.</p>

<h2 id="c19"><span class="h2line1"><span class="sc">Chapter XIX.</span></span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE BRAVERY OF AUNT RIVETTE.</span></h2>
<p>The Roly-Rogues were so busy rioting that they
did not look into the air and discover Aunt Rivette
flying over the city. So she alighted, all unobserved,
upon a balcony of the palace, just outside the chamber
of the Princess Fluff, and succeeded in entering
the room.</p>
<p>The creatures had ransacked this apartment, as they
had every other part of the royal palace, and Fluff&rsquo;s
pretty dresses and ornaments were strewn about in
dreadful confusion. But the drawer in which rested
the magic cloak was still locked, and in a few moments
the old woman had the precious garment in
her hands.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">228</div>
<p>It was, as we know, the imitation cloak Queen Zixi
had made and exchanged for the real one; but so
closely did it resemble the fairy cloak that Aunt Rivette
had no idea she was carrying a useless garment
back to her little niece and nephew. On the contrary,
she thought to herself: &ldquo;Now we can quickly
dispose of these monstrous rogues and drive them
back to their own country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hearing some one moving about in the next room,
she ran to the window and soon was flying away
with the cloak to the place where she had left Bud
and Fluff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; cried the lord high steward, when he
saw the cloak. &ldquo;Now we have nothing more to fear.
Put on your cloak, your Majesty, and make the wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bud threw the cloak over his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall I wish?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see,&rdquo; answered Tallydab. &ldquo;What we
want is to get rid of these invaders. Wish them all
in the kingdom of Ix.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; cried Fluff; &ldquo;it would be wicked to
injure Queen Zixi and her people. Let us wish the
Roly-Rogues back where they came from.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would be folly!&rdquo; said the dog Ruffles, with
an accent of scorn. &ldquo;For they could easily return
again to our city of Nole, having once learned the
way there.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">229</div>
<p>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; agreed Aunt Rivette. &ldquo;The safest
thing to do is to wish them all dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it would be an awful job to bury so many
great balls,&rdquo; objected Bud. &ldquo;It would keep all our
people busy for a month, at least.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not wish them dead and buried?&rdquo; asked
Ruffles. &ldquo;Then they would be out of the way for
good and all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A capital idea!&rdquo; responded Tallydab.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I haven&rsquo;t seen these curious creatures yet,&rdquo;
said Bud; &ldquo;and if I now wish them all dead and
buried, I shall never get a glimpse of one of them.
So let&rsquo;s walk boldly into the city, and when they
appear to interfere with us I&rsquo;ll make the wish and
the Roly-Rogues will instantly disappear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the entire party returned to the city of Nole;
Bud and Fluff riding their ponies, Aunt Rivette fluttering
along beside them, and the lord high steward
walking behind with his dog.</p>
<p>The Roly-Rogues were so much surprised to see
this little party boldly entering the streets of the city,
and showing no particle of fear of them, that they at
first made no offer to molest them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">230</div>
<p>Even when Bud roared with laughter at their queer
appearance, and called them &ldquo;mud-turtles&rdquo; and &ldquo;foot-balls,&rdquo;
they did not resent the insults; for they had
never heard of either a turtle or a foot-ball before.</p>

<p>When the party had reached the palace and the
children had dismounted, Bud laughed yet louder;
for the gigantic General Tollydob came to the kitchen
door, wearing an apron while he polished a big
dish-pan, the Roly-Rogues having made him a
scullion.</p>

<p>The ruler of the Roly-Rogues was suffering from
a toothache, so he had rolled himself into a ball and
made old Tullydub, the lord high counselor, rock him
gently as he lay upon his back, just as one would rock

</div>
<p>Jikki was scratching the back of another Roly-Rogue
with a sharp garden-rake, while Jikki&rsquo;s six
servants stood in a solemn row at his back. They
would do anything for Jikki, but they would not lift
a finger to serve any one else; so the old valet had
to do the scratching unaided.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">233</div>
<p>These six young men had proved a great puzzle
to the Roly-Rogues, for they found it impossible to
touch them or injure them in any way; so, after several
vain attempts to conquer them, they decided to
leave Jikki&rsquo;s servants alone.</p>
<p>The lord high purse-bearer was waving a fan to
keep the flies off two of the slumbering monsters;
and the lord high executioner was feeding another
Roly-Rogue with soup from a great ladle, the creature
finding much amusement in being fed in this
manner.</p>
<p>King Bud, feeling sure of making all his enemies
disappear with a wish, found rare sport in watching
his periwigged counselors thus serving their captors;
so he laughed and made fun of them until the Roly-Rogue
ruler stuck his head out and commanded the
boy to run away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you ugly rascal, I&rsquo;m the King of Noland,&rdquo;
replied Bud; &ldquo;so you&rsquo;d better show me proper
respect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that he picked up a good-sized pebble and
threw it at the ruler. It struck him just over his
aching tooth, and with a roar of anger the Roly-Rogue
bounded toward Bud and his party.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">234</div>
<p>The assault was so sudden that they had much ado
to scramble out of the way; and as soon as Bud
could escape the rush of the huge ball, he turned
squarely around and shouted:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish every one of the Roly-Rogues dead and
buried!&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">235</div>
<p>Hearing this and seeing that the king wore the
magic cloak, all the high counselors at once raised a
joyful shout, and Fluff and Bud gazed upon the Roly-Rogues
expectantly, thinking that of course they
would disappear.</p>
<p>But Zixi&rsquo;s cloak had no magic powers whatever;
and now dozens of the Roly-Rogues, aroused to anger,
bounded toward Bud&rsquo;s little party.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">236</div>
<p>I am sure the result would have been terrible had
not Aunt Rivette suddenly come to the children&rsquo;s
rescue. She threw one lean arm around Bud and
the other around Fluff, and then, quickly fluttering
her wings, she flew with them to the roof of the palace,
which they reached in safety.</p>
<p>The lord high steward and his dog went down
before the rush, and the next moment old Tallydab
was crying loudly for mercy, while Ruffles limped
away to a safe spot beneath a bench under an apple-tree,
howling at every step and shouting angry epithets
at the Roly-Rogues.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder what&rsquo;s the matter with the cloak,&rdquo; gasped
Bud. &ldquo;The old thing&rsquo;s a fraud; it didn&rsquo;t work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something went wrong, that&rsquo;s certain,&rdquo; replied
Fluff. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure you hadn&rsquo;t wished before,
aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; said Bud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said Aunt Rivette, &ldquo;the fairies have no
power over these horrible creatures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That must be it, of course,&rdquo; said the princess.
&ldquo;But what shall we do now? Our country is entirely
conquered by these monsters; so it isn&rsquo;t a safe
place for us to stay in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe I can carry you anywhere you&rsquo;d like to
go,&rdquo; said Aunt Rivette. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not so very heavy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, if she doesn&rsquo;t bear us a grudge.
You know we knocked out her whole army,&rdquo; remarked
Bud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quavo the minstrel says she is very beautiful,
and kind to her people,&rdquo; said the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s no one else we can trust,&rdquo; Bud answered
gloomily; &ldquo;so we may as well try Zixi. But
if you drop either of us on the way, Aunt Rivette,
I&rsquo;ll have to call in the lord high executioner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never fear,&rdquo; replied the old woman. &ldquo;If I drop
you, you&rsquo;ll never know what has happened. So each

<h2 id="c20"><span class="h2line1"><span class="sc">Chapter XX.</span></span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">IN THE PALACE OF THE WITCH-QUEEN.</span></h2>
<p>Bud and Fluff were surprised at the magnificence
of the city of Ix. The witch-queen had reigned there
so many centuries that she found plenty of time to
carry out her ideas; and the gardens, shrubbery, and
buildings were beautifully planned and cared for.</p>
<p>The splendid palace of the queen was in the center
of a delightful park, with white marble walks leading
up to the front door.</p>
<p>Aunt Rivette landed the children at the entrance
to this royal park, and they walked slowly toward
the palace, admiring the gleaming white statues, the
fountains and flowers, as they went.</p>
<p>It was beginning to grow dusk, and the lights were
gleaming in the palace window when they reached
it. Dozens of liveried servants were standing near
the entrance, and some of these escorted the strangers
with much courtesy to a reception room. There a
gray-haired master of ceremonies met them and asked
in what way he might serve them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">241</div>
<p>This politeness almost took Bud&rsquo;s breath away,
for he had considered Queen Zixi in the light of an
enemy rather than a friend; but he decided not to
sail under false colors, so he drew himself up in royal
fashion and answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am King Bud of Noland, and this is my sister,
Princess Fluff, and my Aunt Rivette. My kingdom
has been conquered by a horde of monsters, and I
have come to the Queen of Ix to ask her assistance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The master of ceremonies bowed low and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure Queen Zixi will be glad to assist your
Majesty. Permit me to escort you to rooms, that
you may prepare for an interview with her as soon
a she can receive you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they were led to luxurious chambers, and were
supplied with perfumed baths and clean raiment,
which proved very refreshing after their tedious journey
through the air.</p>
<p>It was now evening; and when they were ushered
into the queen&rsquo;s reception-room the palace was brilliantly
lighted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">242</div>
<p>Zixi, since her great disappointment in the lilac-grove,
had decided that her longing to behold a beautiful
reflection in her mirror was both impossible and
foolish; so she had driven the desire from her heart
and devoted herself to ruling her kingdom wisely, as
she had ruled before the idea of stealing the magic
cloak had taken possession of her. And when her
mind was in normal condition the witch-queen was
very sweet and agreeable in disposition.</p>
<p>So Queen Zixi greeted Bud and his sister and
aunt with great kindness, kissing Fluff affectionately
upon her cheek and giving her own hand to Bud to
kiss.</p>
<p>It is not strange that the children considered her
the most beautiful person they had ever beheld; and
to them she was as gentle as beautiful, listening with
much interest to their tale of the invasion of the Roly-Rogues,
and promising to assist them by every means
in her power.</p>
<p>This made Bud somewhat ashamed of his past enmity;
so he said bluntly: &ldquo;I am sorry we defeated
your army and made them run.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">244</div>

<p class="caption">&ldquo;QUEEN ZIXI GREETED BUD AND HIS SISTER AND AUNT
WITH GREAT KINDNESS.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">245</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that was the only thing you could do, when
I had invaded your dominion,&rdquo; answered Zixi. &ldquo;I
admit that you were in the right, and that I deserved
my defeat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why did you try to conquer us?&rdquo; asked Fluff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I wanted to secure the magic cloak, of
which I had heard so much,&rdquo; returned the queen,
frankly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, of course, you understand that if I had known
the magic cloak could not grant any more wishes, I
would not have been so eager to secure it,&rdquo; continued
Zixi.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Bud; &ldquo;the old thing won&rsquo;t work any
more; and we nearly got captured by the Roly-Rogues
before we found it out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, have you the cloak again?&rdquo; asked Zixi, with
a look of astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed,&rdquo; returned the princess; &ldquo;it was locked
up in my drawer, and Aunt Rivette managed to get
it for me before the Roly-Rogues could find it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Locked in your drawer?&rdquo; repeated the witch-queen,
musingly. &ldquo;Then, I am sorry to say, you
have not the fairy cloak at all, but the imitation one.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">246</div>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; asked Fluff, greatly surprised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I must make a confession,&rdquo; said Zixi, with
a laugh. &ldquo;I tried many ways to steal your magic
cloak. First, I came to Nole as &lsquo;Miss Trust.&rsquo; Do
you remember?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo; cried Fluff; &ldquo;and I mistrusted you
from the first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then I sent my army to capture the cloak.
But, when both of these plans failed, I disguised myself
as the girl Adlena.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Adlena!&rdquo; exclaimed the princess. &ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;ve
often wondered what became of my maid Adlena,
and why she left me so suddenly and mysteriously.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, she exchanged an imitation cloak for the
one the fairies had given you,&rdquo; said Zixi, with a smile.
&ldquo;And then she ran away with the precious garment,
leaving in your drawer a cloak that resembled the
magic garment but had no magical charms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How dreadful!&rdquo; said Fluff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it did me no good,&rdquo; went on the queen, sadly;
&ldquo;for when I made a wish the cloak could not grant it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">247</div>
<p>&ldquo;Because it was stolen!&rdquo; cried the girl, eagerly.
&ldquo;The fairy who gave it to me said that if the cloak
was stolen it would never grant a wish to the thief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Zixi, astonished, &ldquo;I did not know that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; Fluff replied, with a rather triumphant
smile. &ldquo;But if you had only come to me
and told me frankly that you wanted to use the cloak,
I would gladly have lent it to you, and then you could
have had your wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well!&rdquo; said Zixi, much provoked with herself.
&ldquo;To think I have been so wicked all for nothing,
when I might have succeeded without the least
trouble had I frankly asked for what I wanted!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;see here!&rdquo; said Bud, beginning to understand
the tangle of events; &ldquo;I must have worn the
imitation cloak when I made my wish, and that was
the reason that my wish didn&rsquo;t come true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure,&rdquo; rejoined Fluff. &ldquo;And so it is nothing
but the imitation cloak we have brought here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No wonder it would not destroy and bury the
Roly-Rogues!&rdquo; declared the boy, sulkily. &ldquo;But if this
is the imitation, where, then, is the real magic cloak?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I believe I left it in the lilac-grove,&rdquo; replied
Zixi.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_248">248</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then we must find it at once,&rdquo; said Bud; &ldquo;for
only by its aid can we get rid of those Roly-Rogues.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And afterward I will gladly lend it to you also;
I promise now to lend it to you,&rdquo; said Fluff, turning
to the queen; &ldquo;and your wish will be fulfilled, after
all&mdash;whatever it may be.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="pic73">
<img src="images/i_248_0412.jpg" alt="" width="725" height="488" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;&lsquo;BECAUSE IT WAS STOLEN!&rsquo; CRIED THE GIRL, EAGERLY.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>This expression of kindness and good will brought
great joy to Zixi, and she seized the generous child
in her arms and kissed her with real gratitude.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">249</div>
<p>&ldquo;We will start for the lilac-grove to-morrow morning,&rdquo;
she exclaimed delightedly; &ldquo;and before night
both King Bud and I will have our wishes fulfilled!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the witch-queen led them to her royal banquet-hall,
where a most delightful dinner was served.
And all the courtiers and officers of Zixi bowed low,
first before the King of Noland and then before his
sweet little sister, and promised them the friendship
of the entire kingdom of Ix.</p>
<p>Quavo the wandering minstrel chanced to be present
that evening, and he sang a complimentary song
about King Bud; and a wonderful song about the
&ldquo;Flying Lady,&rdquo; meaning Aunt Rivette; and a beautiful
song about the lovely Princess Fluff.</p>
<p>So every one was happy and contented, as they
all looked forward to the morrow to regain the magic
cloak, and by its means to bring an end to all their
worries.</p>

<br /><span class="h2line2">THE SEARCH FOR THE MAGIC CLOAK.</span></h2>
<p>The sun had scarcely risen next morning when our
friends left the city of Ix in search of the magic cloak.
All were mounted on strong horses, with a dozen soldiers
riding behind to protect them from harm, while
the royal steward of the witch-queen followed with
two donkeys laden with hampers of provisions from
which to feed the travelers on their way.</p>
<p>It was a long journey to the wide river, but they
finally reached it, and engaged the ferryman to take
them across. The ferryman did not like to visit the
other shore, which was in the kingdom of Noland;
for several of the Roly-Rogues had already been seen
upon the mountain-top. But the guard of soldiers
reassured the man; so he rowed his big boat across
with the entire party, and set them safely on the
shore. The ferryman&rsquo;s little daughter was in the
boat, but she was not sobbing to-day. On the contrary,
her face was all smiles.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_252">252</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you not still wish to be a man?&rdquo; asked Zixi,
patting the child&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, indeed!&rdquo; answered the little maid. &ldquo;For I
have discovered all men must work very hard to support
their wives and children, and to buy them food and
raiment. So I have changed my mind about becoming
a man, especially as that would be impossible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was not far from the ferry to the grove of lilacs,
and as they rode along Zixi saw the gray owl sitting
contentedly in a tree and pruning its feathers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you no longer wailing because you cannot
swim in the river?&rdquo; asked the witch-queen, speaking
in the owl language.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, indeed,&rdquo; answered the gray owl. &ldquo;For, as I
watched a fish swimming in the water, a man caught
it on a sharp hook, and the fish was killed. I believe
I&rsquo;m safer in a tree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe so, too,&rdquo; said Zixi, and rode along more
thoughtfully; for she remembered her own desire,
and wondered if it would also prove foolish.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_253">253</div>
<p>Just as they left the river-bank she noticed the
old alligator sunning himself happily upon the bank.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic75">
<img src="images/i_253_0524.jpg" alt="" width="736" height="552" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;&lsquo;OF COURSE,&rsquo; ANSWERED THE ALLIGATOR, OPENING ONE EYE TO OBSERVE HIS QUESTIONER.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Have you ceased weeping because you cannot
climb a tree?&rdquo; asked the witch-queen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; answered the alligator, opening one
eye to observe his questioner. &ldquo;For a boy climbed
a tree near me yesterday and fell out of it and broke
his leg. It is quite foolish to climb trees. I&rsquo;m sure
I am safer in the water.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_254">254</div>
<p>Zixi made no reply, but she agreed with the alligator,
who called after her sleepily:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it fortunate we cannot have everything we
are stupid enough to wish for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shortly afterward they left the river-bank and approached
the lilac-grove, the witch-queen riding first
through the trees to show the place where she had
dropped the magic cloak. She knew it was near the
little spring where she had gazed at her reflection in
the water; but, although they searched over every
inch of ground, they could discover no trace of the
lost cloak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is really too bad!&rdquo; exclaimed Zixi, with vexation.
&ldquo;Some one must have come through the grove
and taken the cloak away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we must find it,&rdquo; said Bud, earnestly; &ldquo;for
otherwise I shall not be able to rescue my people
from the Roly-Rogues.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us inquire of every one we meet if they have
seen the cloak,&rdquo; suggested Princess Fluff. &ldquo;In that
way we may discover who has taken it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they made a camp on the edge of the grove,
and for two days they stopped and questioned all who
passed that way. But none had ever seen or heard
of a cloak like that described.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_256">256</div>

<p class="caption">&ldquo;&lsquo;WE HAVE LOST A BEAUTIFUL CLOAK IN THE LILAC-GROVE,&rsquo;
SAID QUEEN ZIXI TO THE SHEPHERD.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_257">257</div>
<p>Finally an old shepherd came along, hobbling painfully
after a flock of five sheep; for he suffered much
from rheumatism.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have lost a beautiful cloak in the lilac-grove,&rdquo;
said Zixi to the shepherd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When did you lose it?&rdquo; asked the old man, pausing
to lean upon his stick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Several days ago,&rdquo; returned the queen. &ldquo;It was
bright as the rainbow, and woven with threads finer
than&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, I know!&rdquo; interrupted the shepherd, &ldquo;for
I myself found it lying upon the ground beneath the
lilac-trees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; cried Bud, gleefully; &ldquo;at last we have
found it!&rdquo; And all the others were fully as delighted
as he was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where have you put the cloak?&rdquo; inquired
Zixi.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_258">258</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I gave it to Dame Dingle, who lives under
the hill yonder,&rdquo; replied the man, pointing far away
over the fields; &ldquo;and she gave me in exchange some
medicine for my rheumatism, which has made the
pain considerably worse. So to-day I threw the
bottle into the river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They did not pause to listen further to the shepherd&rsquo;s
talk, for all were now intent on reaching the
cottage of Dame Dingle.</p>
<p>So the soldiers saddled the horses, and in a few
minutes they were galloping away toward the hill.
It was a long ride, over rough ground; but finally
they came near the hill and saw a tiny, tumbledown
cottage just at its foot.</p>
<p>Hastily dismounting, Bud, Fluff, and the queen
rushed into the cottage, where a wrinkled old woman
was bent nearly double over a crazy-quilt upon which
she was sewing patches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is the cloak?&rdquo; cried the three, in a breath.</p>
<p>The woman did not raise her head, but counted
her stitches in a slow, monotonous tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sixteen&mdash;seventeen&mdash;eighteen&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is the magic cloak?&rdquo; demanded Zixi,
stamping her foot impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nineteen&mdash;&rdquo; said Dame Dingle, slowly. &ldquo;There!
I&rsquo;ve broken my needle!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_259">259</div>
<p>&ldquo;Answer us at once!&rdquo; commanded Bud, sternly.
&ldquo;Where is the magic cloak?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman paid no attention to him whatever.
She carefully selected a new needle, threaded it after
several attempts, and began anew to stitch the patch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty!&rdquo; she mumbled in a low voice; &ldquo;twenty-one&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But now Zixi snatched the work from her hands
and exclaimed;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you do not answer at once I will give you a
good beating!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is all right,&rdquo; said the dame, looking up at
them through her spectacles; &ldquo;the patches take
twenty-one stitches on each side, and if I lose my
count I get mixed up. But it&rsquo;s all right now. What
do you want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cloak the old shepherd gave you,&rdquo; replied the
queen, sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pretty cloak with the bright colors?&rdquo; asked
the dame, calmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! Yes!&rdquo; answered the three, excitedly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_260">260</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that very patch I was sewing was cut from
that cloak,&rdquo; said Dame Dingle. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it lovely?
And it brightens the rest of the crazy-quilt beautifully.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean that you have cut up my magic
cloak?&rdquo; asked Fluff, in amazement, while the others
were too horrified to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said the woman. &ldquo;The cloak was too
fine for me to wear, and I needed something bright
in my crazy-quilt. So I cut up half of the cloak and
made patches of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The witch-queen gave a gasp, and sat down suddenly
upon a rickety bench. Princess Fluff walked
to the door and stood looking out, that the others
might not see the tears of disappointment in her eyes.
Bud alone stood scowling in front of the old dame,
and presently he said to her, in a harsh tone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to be smothered with your own crazy-quilt
for daring to cut up the fairy cloak!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fairy cloak!&rdquo; echoed Dame Dingle. &ldquo;What
do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That cloak was a gift to my sister from the fairies,&rdquo;
said Bud; &ldquo;and it had a magic charm. Aren&rsquo;t you
afraid the fairies will punish you for what you have
done?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_261">261</div>
<div class="img" id="pic77">

<p class="caption">&ldquo;&lsquo;WHERE IS THE CLOAK?&rsquo; CRIED THE THREE, IN A BREATH.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Dame Dingle was greatly disturbed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could I know it?&rdquo; she asked, anxiously;
&ldquo;how could I know it was a magic cloak that old Edi
gave to me?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_262">262</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it was; and woven by the fairies themselves,&rdquo;
retorted the boy. &ldquo;And a whole nation is
in danger because you have wickedly cut it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dame Dingle tried to cry, to show that she was
sorry and so escape punishment. She put her apron
over her face, and rocked herself back and forth, and
made an attempt to squeeze a tear out of her eyes.</p>
<p>Suddenly Zixi jumped up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it isn&rsquo;t so bad, after all!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
&ldquo;We can sew the cloak together again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; said Fluff, coming from the doorway.
&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t we think of that at once?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is the rest of the cloak?&rdquo; demanded Zixi.</p>
<p>Dame Dingle went to a chest and drew forth the
half of the cloak that had not been cut up. There
was no doubt about its being the magic cloak. The
golden thread Queen Lulea had woven could be seen
plainly in the web, and the brilliant colors were as
fresh and lovely as ever. But the flowing skirt of
the cloak had been ruthlessly hacked by Dame Dingle&rsquo;s
shears, and presented a sorry plight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_263">263</div>
<p>&ldquo;Get us the patches you have cut!&rdquo; commanded
Zixi; and without a word the dame drew from her
basket five small squares and then ripped from the
crazy-quilt the one she had just sewn on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this isn&rsquo;t enough,&rdquo; said Fluff, when she had
spread the cloak upon the floor and matched the
pieces. &ldquo;Where is the rest of the cloak?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&mdash;why&mdash;&rdquo; stammered Dame Dingle, with
hesitation, &ldquo;I gave them away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gave them away! Who got them?&rdquo; said Bud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&mdash;some friends of mine were here from the
village last evening, and we traded patches, so each
of us would have a variety for our crazy-quilts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I gave each of them one of the patches from
the pretty cloak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you <i>are</i> a ninny!&rdquo; declared Bud, scornfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, your Majesty; I believe I am,&rdquo; answered
Dame Dingle, meekly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must go to the village and gather up those
pieces,&rdquo; said Zixi. &ldquo;Can you tell us the names of
your friends?&rdquo; she asked the woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; responded Dame Dingle; &ldquo;they were
Nancy Nink, Betsy Barx, Sally Sog, Molly Mitt, and
Lucy Lum.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_264">264</div>
<p>&ldquo;Before we go to the village let us make Dame
Dingle sew these portions of the cloak together,&rdquo; suggested
Fluff.</p>
<p>The dame was glad enough to do this, and she
threaded her needle at once. So deft and fine was
her needlework that she mended the cloak most beautifully,
so that from a short distance away no one
could discover that the cloak had been darned. But
a great square was still missing from the front, and
our friends were now eager to hasten to the village.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This will cause us some delay,&rdquo; said the witch-queen,
more cheerfully; &ldquo;but the cloak will soon be
complete again, and then we can have our wishes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fluff took the precious cloak over her arm, and
then they all mounted their horses and rode away
toward the village, which Dame Dingle pointed out
from her doorway. Zixi was sorry for the old creature,
who had been more foolish than wicked; and
the witch-queen left a bright gold piece in the woman&rsquo;s
hand when she bade her good-by, which was worth
more to Dame Dingle than three pretty cloaks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_265">265</div>
<p>The ground was boggy and uneven, so they were
forced to ride slowly to the little village; but they
arrived there at last, and began hunting for the old
women who had received pieces of the magic cloak.
They were easily found, and all seemed willing enough
to give up their patches when the importance of the
matter was explained to them.</p>
<p>At the witch-queen&rsquo;s suggestion, each woman fitted
her patch to the cloak and sewed it on very neatly;
but Lucy Lum, the last of the five, said to them:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is only half of the patch Dame Dingle gave
me. The other part I gave to the miller&rsquo;s wife down
in the valley where the river bends. But I am sure
she will be glad to let you have it. See&mdash;it only
requires that small piece to complete the cloak and
make it as good as new.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was true&mdash;the magic cloak, except for a small
square at the bottom, was now complete; and such
skillful needlewomen were these crazy-quilt makers
that it was difficult to tell where it had been cut and
afterward mended.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_266">266</div>
<p>But the miller&rsquo;s wife must now be seen; so they
all mounted the horses again, except Aunt Rivette,
who grumbled that so much riding made her bones
rattle and that she preferred to fly. Which she did,
frightening the horses to such an extent with her
wings that Bud made her keep well in advance of
them.</p>
<p>They were all in good spirits now, for soon the
magic cloak, almost as good as new, would be again
in their possession; and Fluff and Bud had been
greatly worried over the fate of their friends who had
been left to the mercy of the terrible Roly-Rogues.</p>
<p>The path ran in a zigzag direction down into the
valley; but at length it led the party to the mill,
where old Rivette was found sitting in the doorway
awaiting them.</p>
<p>The miller&rsquo;s wife, when summoned, came to them
drying her hands on her apron, for she had been
washing the dishes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want to get the bright-colored patch Lucy
Lum gave you,&rdquo; explained Fluff; &ldquo;for it was part of
my magic cloak, which the fairies gave to me, and
this is the place where it must be sewn to complete
the garment.&rdquo; And she showed the woman the cloak,
with the square missing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_267">267</div>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said the miller&rsquo;s wife, nodding her head;
&ldquo;and I am very sorry I cannot give you the piece to
complete your cloak. But the fact is, I considered
it too pretty for my crazy-quilt, so I gave it to my son
for a necktie.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="pic78">
<img src="images/i_267_0527.jpg" alt="" width="735" height="562" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;&lsquo;AND WHERE IS YOUR SON?&rsquo; DEMANDED ZIXI.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;And where is your son?&rdquo; demanded Zixi.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he is gone to sea, for he is a sailor. By this
time he is far away upon the ocean.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_268">268</div>
<p>Bud, Fluff, and the witch-queen looked at one another
in despair. This seemed, indeed, to destroy all
their hopes; for the one portion of the cloak that they
needed was far beyond their reach.</p>
<p>Nothing remained but for them to return to Zixi&rsquo;s
palace and await the time when the miller&rsquo;s son should
return from his voyage. But before they went the
queen said to the woman:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When he returns you may tell your son that if he
will bring to me the necktie you gave him, I will give
him in return fifty gold pieces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I will give him fifty more,&rdquo; said Bud,
promptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I will give him enough ribbon to make fifty
neckties,&rdquo; added Fluff.</p>
<p>The miller&rsquo;s wife was delighted at the prospect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you! Thank you!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;My
boy&rsquo;s fortune is made. He can now marry Imogene
Gubb and settle down on a farm, and give up the sea
forever! And his neckties will be the envy of all the
men in the country. As soon as he returns I will
send him to you with the bit of the cloak which you
need.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_269">269</div>
<p>But Zixi was so anxious that nothing might happen
to prevent the miller&rsquo;s son from returning the
necktie, that she left two of her soldiers at the mill,
with instructions to bring the man to her palace the
instant he returned home.</p>
<p>As they rode away they were all very despondent
over the ill luck of their journey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He may be drowned at sea,&rdquo; said Bud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or he may lose the necktie on the voyage,&rdquo; said
Fluff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, a thousand things <i>might</i> happen,&rdquo; returned
the queen; &ldquo;but we need not make ourselves unhappy
imagining them. Let us hope the miller&rsquo;s son will
soon return and restore to us the missing patch.&rdquo;
Which showed that Zixi had not lived six hundred
and eighty-three years without gaining some wisdom.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_271">271</div>
<h2 id="c22"><span class="h2line1"><span class="sc">Chapter XXII.</span></span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">RUFFLES CARRIES THE SILVER VIAL.</span></h2>
<p>When they were back at the witch-queen&rsquo;s palace
in the city of Ix, the queen insisted that Bud and
Fluff, with their Aunt Rivette, should remain her
guests until the cloak could be restored to its former
complete state. And, for fear something else might
happen to the precious garment, a silver chest was
placed in Princess Fluff&rsquo;s room and the magic cloak
safely locked therein, the key being carried upon the
chain around the girl&rsquo;s neck.</p>
<p>But their plans to wait patiently were soon interfered
with by the arrival at Zixi&rsquo;s court of the talking
dog, Ruffles, which had with much difficulty escaped
from the Roly-Rogues.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_272">272</div>
<p>Ruffles brought to them so sad and harrowing a
tale of the sufferings of the five high counselors and
all the people of Noland at the hands of the fierce
Roly-Rogues, that Princess Fluff wept bitterly for
her friends, and Bud became so cross and disagreeable
that even Zixi was provoked with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something really must be done,&rdquo; declared the
queen. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll brew a magical mess in my witch-kettle
to-night, and see if I can find a way to destroy those
detestable Roly-Rogues.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Indeed, she feared the creatures would some day
find their way into Ix; so when all the rest of those
in the palace were sound asleep, Zixi worked her
magic spell, and from the imps she summoned she
obtained advice how to act in order to get rid of the
Roly-Rogues.</p>
<p>Next morning she questioned Ruffles carefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do the Roly-Rogues eat?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything,&rdquo; said the dog; &ldquo;for they have no
judgment, and consume buttons and hairpins as
eagerly as they do food. But there is one thing they
are really fond of, and that is soup. They oblige old
Tollydob, the lord high general, who works in the
palace kitchen, to make them a kettle of soup every
morning; and this they all eat as if they were half
starving.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_273">273</div>
<p>&ldquo;Very good!&rdquo; exclaimed the witch-queen, with
pleasure. &ldquo;I think I see a way of ridding all Noland
of these monsters. Here is a Silver Vial filled
with a magic liquid. I will tie it around your neck,
and you must return to the city of Nole and carry
the vial to Tollydob, the lord high general. Tell him
that on Thursday morning, when he makes the kettle
of soup, he must put the contents of the vial into the
compound. But let no one taste it afterward except
the Roly-Rogues.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what then?&rdquo; asked Ruffles, curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I will myself take charge of the monsters;
and I have reason to believe the good citizens of Noland
will no longer find themselves slaves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said the dog. &ldquo;I will do as you bid
me; for I long to free my master and have revenge
on the Roly-Rogues.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Queen Zixi tied the Silver Vial to the dog&rsquo;s
neck by means of a broad ribbon, and he started at
once to return to Nole.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_274">274</div>
<p>And when he had gone, the queen summoned all
her generals and bade them assemble the entire army
and prepare to march into Noland again. Only this
time, instead of being at enmity with the people of
Noland, the army of Ix was to march to their relief;
and instead of bearing swords and spears, each man
bore a coil of strong rope.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic80">
<img src="images/i_274_0530.jpg" alt="" width="758" height="507" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;HE STARTED AT ONCE TO RETURN TO NOLE.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;For,&rdquo; said Zixi, &ldquo;swords and spears are useless
where the Roly-Rogues are concerned, as nothing
can pierce their tough, rubber-like bodies. And more
nations have been conquered by cunning than by
force of arms.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_275">275</div>
<p>Bud and Fluff, not knowing what the witch-queen
meant to do, were much disturbed by these preparations
to march upon the Roly-Rogues. The monsters
had terrified them so greatly that they dreaded
to meet with them again, and Bud declared that the
safest plan was to remain in Zixi&rsquo;s kingdom and await
the coming of the miller&rsquo;s son with the necktie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; remonstrated Zixi, &ldquo;in the meantime your
people are suffering terribly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Bud; &ldquo;and it nearly drives me
frantic to think of it But they will be no better off
if we try to fight the Roly-Rogues and are ourselves
made slaves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not try the magic cloak as it is,&rdquo; suggested
the princess, &ldquo;and see if it won&rsquo;t grant wishes
as before? There&rsquo;s only a small piece missing, and
it may not make any difference with the power the
fairies gave to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hooray!&rdquo; shouted Bud. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good idea.
It&rsquo;s a magic cloak just the same, even if there is a
chunk cut out of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zixi agreed that it was worth a trial, so the cloak
was taken from the silver casket and brought into the
queen&rsquo;s reception-room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_276">276</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let us try it on one of your maids of honor, first,&rdquo;
said Fluff; &ldquo;and, if it grants her wish, we will know
the cloak has lost none of its magic powers. Then
you and Bud may both make your wishes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; returned the queen, and she summoned
one of her maids.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to lend you my cloak,&rdquo; said the princess
to the maid; &ldquo;and while you wear it you must
make a wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She threw the cloak over the girl&rsquo;s shoulders, and
after a moment&rsquo;s thought the maid said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish for a bushel of candies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fudge!&rdquo; said Bud, scornfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; all kinds of candies,&rdquo; answered the maid of
honor. But, although they watched her intently, the
wish failed absolutely, for no bushel of candies appeared
in sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us try it again,&rdquo; suggested Fluff, while the
others wore disappointed expressions. &ldquo;It was a
foolish wish, anyhow; and perhaps the fairies did
not care to grant it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So another maid was called and given the cloak
to wear.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_277">277</div>
<div class="img" id="pic81">

<p class="caption">&ldquo;&lsquo;AND MAY I WISH FOR ANYTHING I DESIRE?&rsquo; SHE ASKED EAGERLY.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;And may I wish for anything I desire?&rdquo; she
asked eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; answered the princess; &ldquo;but, as you can
have but one wish, you must choose something sensible.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_278">278</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I will!&rdquo; declared the maid. &ldquo;I wish I had
yellow hair and blue eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you wish that?&rdquo; asked Fluff, angrily,
for the girl had pretty brown hair and eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because the young man I am going to marry
says he likes blondes better than brunettes,&rdquo; answered
the maid, blushing.</p>
<p>But her hair did not change its color, for all the
wish; and the maid said, with evident disappointment:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your magic cloak seems to be a fraud.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does not grant foolish wishes,&rdquo; returned the
princess, as she dismissed her.</p>
<p>When the maid had gone Zixi asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, are you satisfied?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; acknowledged Fluff. &ldquo;The cloak will not
grant wishes unless it is complete. We must wait
for the sailorman&rsquo;s necktie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then my army shall march to-morrow morning,&rdquo;
said the queen, and she went away to give the order
to her generals.</p>

<br /><span class="h2line2">THE DESTRUCTION OF THE MONSTERS.</span></h2>
<p>It was Tuesday when the army of Ix started upon
its second march into Noland. With it were the
witch-queen, King Bud, Princess Fluff, and Aunt
Rivette. At evening they encamped on the bank
of the river, and on Wednesday the army was ferried
across, and marched up the side of the mountain that
separated them from the valley of Noland. By night
they had reached the summit of the mountain; but
they did not mount upon the ridge, for fear they might
be seen by the Roly-Rogues.</p>
<p>Zixi commanded them all to remain quietly behind
the ridge, and they lighted no fires and spoke only
in whispers.</p>
<p>And, although so many thousands of men lay close
to the valley of Noland, not a sound came from them
to warn the monsters that an enemy was near.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_280">280</div>
<p>Thursday morning dawned bright and pleasant,
and as soon as the sun was up the Roly-Rogues
came crowding around the palace kitchen, demanding
that old Tollydob hurry the preparation of their soup.</p>
<p>This the general did, trembling in spite of his ten
feet of stature; for if they were kept waiting the monsters
were liable to prod his flesh with their thorns.</p>
<p>But Tollydob did not forget to empty the contents
of the Silver Vial into the soup, as the dog Ruffles
had told him to do; and soon it was being ladled out
to the Roly-Rogues by Jikki, the four high counselors,
and a dozen other enslaved officers of King Bud.</p>
<p>And the dog Ruffles ran through the city, crying to
every Roly-Rogue he met: &ldquo;Hurry and get your soup
before it is gone. It is especially good this morning!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So every Roly-Rogue in the valley hurried to the
palace kitchen for soup; and there were so many that
it was noon before the last were served, while these
became so impatient that they abused their slaves in
a sad manner.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_281">281</div>
<p>Yet, even while the last were eating, those who
had earlier partaken of the soup lay around the palace
sound asleep and snoring loudly; for the contents
of the Silver Vial had the effect of sending all of them
to sleep within an hour, and rendering them wholly
unconscious for a period of ten hours.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic82">
<img src="images/i_281_0641.jpg" alt="" width="699" height="753" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;AND THE DOG RUFFLES RAN THROUGH THE CITY, CRYING TO EVERY ROLY-ROGUE HE MET:
&lsquo;HURRY AND GET YOUR SOUP.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_282">282</div>
<p>All through the city the Roly-Rogues lay asleep;
and, as they always withdrew their heads and limbs
into their bodies when they slumbered, they presented a
spectacle of thousands of huge balls lying motionless.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic83">
<img src="images/i_282_0642.jpg" alt="" width="705" height="788" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;ALL THROUGH THE CITY THE ROLY-ROGUES LAY ASLEEP.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_283">283</div>
<p>When the big kettle was finally empty and the lord
high general paused to wipe the perspiration from his
brow, the last of the Roly-Rogues were rolling over
on their backs from the effects of the potion which
the witch-queen brewed and placed in the Silver Vial.</p>
<p>Aunt Rivette had been flying over the city since
early morning; and although the Roly-Rogues had
been too intent upon their breakfast to notice her, the
old woman&rsquo;s sharp eyes had watched everything that
took place below.</p>
<p>Now, when all the monsters had succumbed to the
witch-potion, Aunt Rivette flew back to the mountain
where the army of Ix was hidden, and carried
the news to the witch-queen.</p>
<p>Zixi at once ordered her generals to advance, and
the entire army quickly mounted the summit of the
ridge and ran down the side of the mountain to the
gates of the city.</p>
<p>The people, who saw that something unusual was
taking place, greeted Bud and Fluff and the witch-queen
with shouts of gladness; and even Aunt Rivette,
when she flew down among them, was given
three hearty cheers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_284">284</div>
<p>But there was no time for joyous demonstrations
while the streets and public squares were cluttered
with the sleeping bodies of the terrible Roly-Rogues.
The army of Ix lost no time in carrying out their
queen&rsquo;s instructions; and as soon as they entered the
city they took the long ropes they carried and wound
them fast about the round bodies of the monsters,
securely fastening their heads and limbs into their
forms so that they could not stick them out again.</p>
<p>Their enemies being thus rendered helpless, the
people renewed their shouts of joy and gratitude, and
eagerly assisted the soldiers of Ix in rolling all the
Roly-Rogues outside the gates and to a wide ledge
of the mountain.</p>
<p>The lord high general and all the other counselors
threw away their aprons and tools of servitude and
dressed themselves in their official robes. The soldiers
of Tollydob&rsquo;s army ran for their swords and
pikes, and the women unlocked their doors and
trooped into the streets of Nole for the first time
since the descent of the monsters.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_285">285</div>

<p class="caption">&ldquo;ALL THE ROLY-ROGUES WERE THUS ROLLED INTO THE RIVER, WHERE
THEY BOBBED UP AND DOWN IN THE WATER.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_287">287</div>
<p>But the task of liberation was not yet accomplished.
All the Roly-Rogues had to be rolled up the side of
the mountain to the topmost ridge, and so great was
the bulk of their bodies that it took five or six men
to roll each one to the mountain-top; and even then
they were obliged to stop frequently to rest.</p>
<p>But as soon as they got a Roly-Rogue to the ridge
they gave it a push and sent it bounding down the
other side of the mountain until it fell into the big
river flowing swiftly below.</p>
<p>During the afternoon all the Roly-Rogues were
thus dumped into the river, where they bobbed up
and down in the water, spinning around and bumping
against one another until the current carried them
out of sight on their journey to the sea. It was rumored
later that they had reached an uninhabited
island where they harm no one except themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad they floated,&rdquo; said Zixi, as she stood
upon the mountain ridge and watched the last of the
monsters float out of sight; &ldquo;for if they had sunk
they would have filled up the river, there were so
many of them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_288">288</div>
<p>It was evening when Noland at last became free
from her terrible tyrants; and the citizens illuminated
the entire city that they might spend the night in
feasting and rejoicing over their freedom. The soldiers
of Ix were embraced and made much of; and
at all the feasts they were the honored guests, while
the people of Noland pledged them their sincere
friendship forever.</p>
<p>King Bud took possession of the royal palace
again, and Jikki bustled about and prepared a grand
banquet for the king&rsquo;s guests,&mdash;although the old valet
grumbled a great deal because his six solemn servants
would not assist in waiting upon any one but himself.</p>
<p>The Roly-Rogues had destroyed many things, but
the servants of the palace managed to quickly clear
away the rubbish and to decorate the banquet-hall
handsomely.</p>
<p>Bud placed the beautiful witch-queen upon his right
hand and showed her great honor, for he was really
very grateful for her assistance in rescuing his country
from the invaders.</p>
<p>The feasting and dancing lasted far into the night;
but when at last the people sought their beds they
knew they might rest peacefully and free from care,
for the Roly-Rogues had gone forever.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_289">289</div>
<h2 id="c24"><span class="h2line1"><span class="sc">Chapter XXIV.</span></span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE SAILORMAN&rsquo;S RETURN.</span></h2>
<p>Next day the witch-queen returned with her army
to the city of Ix, to await the coming of the sailorman
with the necktie, and King Bud set about getting his
kingdom into running order again.</p>
<p>The lord high purse-bearer dug up his magic purse,
and Bud ordered him to pay the shopkeepers full
value for everything the Roly-Rogues had destroyed.
The merchants were thus enabled to make purchases
of new stocks of goods; and although all travelers
had for many days kept away from Noland, for fear
of the monsters, caravans now flocked in vast numbers
to the city of Nole with rich stores of merchandise
to sell, so that soon the entire city looked like a
huge bazaar.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_290">290</div>
<p>Bud also ordered a gold piece given to the head
of every family; and this did no damage to the ever-filled
royal purse, while it meant riches to the poor
people who had suffered so much.</p>
<p>Princess Fluff had carried her silver chest back to
the palace of her brother, and in it lay, carefully folded,
the magic cloak. Being now fearful of losing it, she
warned Jikki to allow no one to enter the room in
which lay the silver chest, except with her full consent,
explaining to him the value of the cloak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And was it this cloak I wore when I wished for
half a dozen servants?&rdquo; asked the old valet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Fluff; &ldquo;Aunt Rivette bade you
return it to me, and you were so careless of it that
nearly all the high counselors used it before I found
it again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Jikki, heedless of the reproof, &ldquo;will
your Highness please use the cloak to rid me of these
stupid servants? They are continually at my heels,
waiting to serve me; and I am so busy myself serving
others that those six young men almost drive me
distracted. It wouldn&rsquo;t be so bad if they would
serve any one else; but they claim they are my servants
alone, and refuse to wait upon even his Majesty
the king.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_291">291</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sometime I will try to help you,&rdquo; answered Fluff;
&ldquo;but I shall not use the cloak again until the miller&rsquo;s
son returns from his voyage at sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Jikki was forced to wait as impatiently as the
others for the sailorman, and his servants had now
become such a burden upon him that he grumbled
every time he looked around and saw them standing
in a stiff line behind him.</p>
<p>Aunt Rivette again took possession of her rooms
at the top of the palace; and although Bud, grateful
for her courage in saving him and his sister from the
Roly-Rogues, would gladly have given her handsomer
apartments, the old woman preferred to be
near the roof, where she could take flight into the
air whenever it pleased her to go out.</p>
<p>With her big wings and her power to fly as a bird,
she was the envy of all the old gossips she had known
in the days when she worked as a laundress; and
now she would often alight upon the door-step of
some humble friend and tell of the wonderful adventures
she had encountered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_292">292</div>
<p>This never failed to surround her with an admiring
circle of listeners, and Aunt Rivette derived far more
pleasure from her tattle than from living in a palace
with her nephew the king.</p>
<p>The kingdom of Noland soon took on a semblance
of its former prosperity, and the Roly-Rogues were
only remembered with shudders of repugnance, and
spoken of in awed whispers.</p>
<p>And so the days wore away until late in the autumn,
when, one morning, a mounted soldier from
Queen Zixi dashed into Nole and rode furiously up
to the palace gate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sailorman is found!&rdquo; he shouted, throwing
himself from his horse and bowing low before little
King Bud, who had come out to meet him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; remarked Bud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Queen of Ix is even now riding to your
Majesty&rsquo;s city with a large escort surrounding the
sailorman,&rdquo; continued the soldier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And has he the necktie?&rdquo; asked Bud, eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is wearing it, your Majesty,&rdquo; answered the
man; &ldquo;but he refuses to give it to any one but the
Princess Fluff.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_293">293</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said the king; and, re&euml;ntering
the palace, he ordered Jikki to make preparations
to receive the witch-queen and her retinue.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic85">

<p class="caption">&ldquo;&lsquo;THE SAILORMAN IS FOUND!&rsquo; HE SHOUTED.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_294">294</div>
<p>When Zixi came to the city gates she found General
Tollydob, in a gorgeous new uniform, waiting to
escort her to the palace. The houses were gay with
flags and streamers; bands were playing; and on
each side of the street along which the witch-queen
rode were lines of soldiers to keep the way clear of
the crowding populace.</p>
<p>Behind the queen came the sailorman, carefully
guarded by Zixi&rsquo;s most trusted soldiers. He looked
uneasy at so great a reception, and rode his horse as
awkwardly as a sailor might.</p>
<p>So the cavalcade came to the palace, which was
thronged with courtiers and ladies in waiting.</p>
<p>Zixi and the sailorman were ushered into the great
throne room, where King Bud, wearing his ermine
robe and jeweled crown, sat gravely upon his throne,
with Princess Fluff beside him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Majesty,&rdquo; began the witch-queen, bowing
prettily, &ldquo;I have brought you the sailorman at last.
He has just returned from his voyage, and my soldiers
captured him at his mother&rsquo;s cottage by the
mill. But he refuses to give the necktie to any one
except the Princess Fluff.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_295">295</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am the Princess Fluff,&rdquo; said Meg to the sailor;
&ldquo;and your necktie is part of my magic cloak. So
please give it back to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sailor shifted uneasily from one foot to the
other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mother told me,&rdquo; he finally said, &ldquo;that King
Bud would give me fifty gold pieces for it, and the
Queen of Ix would give me another fifty gold pieces,
and that your Highness would give me fifty neckties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is all true,&rdquo; returned Fluff; &ldquo;so here are the
fifty neckties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tillydib, the lord high purse-bearer, counted out
fifty gold pieces, and Zixi&rsquo;s treasurer counted out another
fifty, and all were given to the sailorman.</p>
<p>Then the miller&rsquo;s son unfastened the necktie from
about his collar and handed it to Fluff.</p>
<p>During the murmur of satisfaction that followed,
the girl unlocked her silver chest, which Jikki had
brought, and drew out the magic cloak. Lifting the
skirt of the garment, she attempted to fit the sailor&rsquo;s
necktie into the place it should go; and then, while
every one looked on with breathless interest, the girl
lifted a white face to the sailorman and exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is not the necktie your mother gave you!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_296">296</div>
<div class="img" id="pic86">
<img src="images/i_296_0648.jpg" alt="" width="735" height="664" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;&lsquo;THIS IS NOT THE NECKTIE YOUR MOTHER GAVE YOU!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>For a moment there was silence, while the assemblage
glared angrily upon the sailor. Then the king,
rising from his seat, demanded:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure, Fluff? Are you sure of that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; said the girl; &ldquo;it is neither
the shape nor the color of the missing patch.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_297">297</div>
<p>Bud turned to the now trembling sailor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why have you tried to deceive us?&rdquo; he asked
sternly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, your Majesty!&rdquo; returned the man, wringing
his hands miserably, &ldquo;I lost the necktie in a gale at
sea, for I knew nothing of its value. And when I
came home my mother told me of all the gold you
had offered for its return, and advised me to deceive
you by wearing another necktie. She said you would
never know the difference.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your mother is a foolish woman, as well as dishonest,&rdquo;
answered Bud; &ldquo;and you shall both be severely
punished. Tellydeb,&rdquo; he continued, addressing
the lord high executioner, &ldquo;take this man to prison,
and see that he is fed on bread and water until further
orders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so!&rdquo; exclaimed a sweet voice near the king;
and then all looked up to see the beautiful Lulea,
queen of the fairies, standing beside the throne.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_298">298</div>
<h2 id="c25"><span class="h2line1"><span class="sc">Chapter XXV.</span></span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE FAIRY QUEEN.</span></h2>
<p>Every eye was now fixed upon the exquisite form
of the fairy queen, which shed a glorious radiance
throughout the room, and filled every heart with an
awe and admiration not unmingled with fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The magic cloak was woven by my band,&rdquo; said
the fairy, speaking so distinctly that all could hear
the words; &ldquo;and our object was to bring relief to
suffering mortal&mdash;not to add to their worries. Some
good the cloak has accomplished, I am sure; but also
has it been used foolishly, and to no serious purpose.
Therefore I, who gave the cloak, shall now
take it away. The good that has been done shall
remain; but the foolish wishes granted shall now be
canceled.&rdquo; With these words, she turned and lightly
lifted the shimmering magic garment from the lap of
the princess.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_300">300</div>
<div class="img" id="pic87">
<img src="images/i_300_0640.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="979" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;&lsquo;I WISH,&rsquo; GRAVELY ANNOUNCED BUD, &lsquo;THAT I MAY BECOME THE BEST
KING THAT NOLAND HAS EVER HAD.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_301">301</div>
<p>&ldquo;One moment, please!&rdquo; cried Bud, eagerly. &ldquo;Cannot
I have my wish? I waited until I could wish wisely,
you know; and then the cloak wouldn&rsquo;t work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a smile, Lulea threw the cloak over the boy&rsquo;s
shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wish!&rdquo; said she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish,&rdquo; announced Bud, gravely, &ldquo;that I may
become the best king that Noland has ever had!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your wish is granted,&rdquo; returned the fairy, sweetly;
&ldquo;and it shall be the last wish fulfilled through the
magic cloak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But now Zixi rushed forward and threw herself
upon her knees before the fairy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, your Majesty&mdash;&rdquo; she began eagerly; but
Lulea instantly silenced her with an abrupt gesture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plead not to me, Queen of Ix!&rdquo; said the dainty
immortal, drawing back from Zixi&rsquo;s prostrate form.
&ldquo;You know that we fairies do not approve of witchcraft.
However long your arts may permit you to
live, you must always beware a mirror!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zixi gave a sob and buried her pretty face in her
hands; and it was Fluff whose tender heart prompted
her to raise the witch-queen and try to comfort her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_302">302</div>
<p>For a moment all present had looked at Zixi.
When their eyes again sought the form of the fairy,
Lulea had vanished, and with her disappeared forever
from Noland the magic cloak.</p>
<p>Some important changes had been wrought through
the visit of the fairy. Jikki&rsquo;s six servants were gone,
to the old valet&rsquo;s great delight. The ten-foot general
had shrunken to six feet in height, Lulea having generously
refrained from reducing old Tollydob to his
former short stature. Ruffles, to the grief of the lord
high steward, could no longer talk; but Tallydab
comforted himself with the knowledge that his dog
could at least understand every word addressed to
him. The lord high executioner found he could no
longer reach farther than other men; but the royal
purse of old Tillydib remained ever filled, which assured
the future prosperity of the kingdom of Noland.</p>
<p>As for Zixi, she soon became reconciled to her
fate, and returned to Ix to govern her country with
her former liberality and justice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_303">303</div>
<p>The last wish granted by the magic cloak was
doubtless the most beneficial and far-reaching of all;
for King Bud ruled many years with exceeding wisdom
and gentleness, and was greatly beloved by each
and every one of his admiring subjects.</p>
<p>The cheerfulness and sweet disposition of Princess
Fluff became renowned throughout the world, and
when she grew to womanhood many brave and handsome
princes from other countries came to Nole to
sue for her heart and hand. One of these she married,
and reigned as queen of a great nation in after
years, winning quite as much love and respect from
her people as his loyal subjects bestowed upon her
famous brother, King Bud of Noland.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
